- Convert terms like “vibration,” “frequency,” “karmic” into:  
  - “emotional pattern,” “habit loop,” “life theme,” “life season.”  
- Example:  
  - Instead of “You’re in a 7 vibration,” use: “2026 is your ‘inner retreat and wisdom’ year.”

### 4.2 Chart, Grid & Destiny Map Visual Simplification

**Visual Types to Use in Videos:**

1. **3×3 Lo Shu Grid**  
   - Use icons for each number:  
     - 1 = seed, 2 = partnership, 3 = expression, etc.  

2. **9-Year Numerology Timeline Bar**

   - Third: Sun/Rising sign.  
   - Bottom: Chinese zodiac animal.  

These allow viewers to **visually anchor** their place in multiple systems.

### 4.3 Personal, Universal & Multi-Year Cycle Storytelling

- **Personal**:  
  - Your life path + 2026 personal year + monthly cycles.  
- **Universal**:  
  - Universal Year 2026 + global transits + Horse year.  
- **Multi-Year**:

### 4.4 Multi-System Fusion for High-Authority Predictions

- Use a **“3 Witness” Rule** for public predictions to stay responsible:  
  - Only make strong forecast statements when **3 independent systems** point to same theme (e.g., money growth, relationship tension).  
  - Example:  
    - Personal Year 8 (numerology) + Jupiter transit to 10th house (Western) + strong wealth element in BaZi for 2026 → high-confidence career/money opportunity forecast.
