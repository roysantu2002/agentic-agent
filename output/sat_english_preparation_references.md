## 3) Integration guide — unify best practices (Reading + Writing)

Principles to integrate:
- Official exposure + targeted pedagogy + deep explanations + adaptive remediation = fastest gains.
- Weekly full-length official tests for calibration; daily adaptive practice to fix the largest gaps; rule frameworks to convert “errors” into mastered patterns.

Reading focus (skills & practice)
- Skills: Critical reasoning, author purpose, inference, evidence-based answers, vocabulary-in-context, passage structure.
- Best practices:
  - Pre-read passage structure (quick 10–15 second paragraph tag: topic + purpose).
  - Classify question type before looking at choices (main idea, inference, function, VOC, evidence).
  - Use Erica Meltzer’s passage-mapping to tag tone/purpose and to mark transitions.
  - Timed practice: aim for ~10–12 minutes per long passage (initially), reduce to 8–9 as speed improves.
  - Transfer practice to official items on Khan Academy & College Board; use UWorld for tricky reasoning items.

Writing focus (skills & practice)
- Skills: Grammar rules (subject-verb agreement, verb tense, pronouns, parallelism), punctuation (comma, semicolon, colon), sentence structure, concision, rhetorical effectiveness.
- Best practices:
  - Learn high‑yield rules via Meltzer + PrepScholar lists.
  - Do targeted Writing & Language sets on Khan Academy and UWorld; use spaced repetition for rules.
  - For rhetorical questions, practice identifying paragraph-level purpose and transitions.
  - Learn to eliminate by spotting grammar/syntax errors in context rather than scanning words.

Unified daily routine elements (compact, repeatable)
- Diagnostic / adaptive practice (Khan Academy): find & close biggest gap.
- Rule + flashcard review (Meltzer + PrepScholar): 15–30 minutes.
- Timed passage or section under exam conditions: 30–45 minutes.
- Explanations & error log review (UWorld or KA explanations): 20–40 minutes with deliberate reflection.
- Weekly full test (College Board) + error-categorization + targeted remediation plan for next week.

- Take official test as a final simulation (or actual test day if scheduled).
- Post-test: careful review of errors; consolidate final learnings for future upkeep.
- Final reflection: quantify improvement (score delta), list remaining focus areas for maintenance.

Notes on timing flexibility
- If you can only do 1 hour/day, compress tasks: prioritize KA 30–40 mins + Meltzer 20–30 mins + daily flashcards.
- If you can do 2+ hours/day, add more UWorld sets and repeat timed passages.

## 6) Error‑log & reflection cycle (daily/weekly)
- Error log columns: Date, Question #, Passage (topic), Question type (main idea/inference/VOC/function/evidence/grammar/punctuation/concision), Your answer, Correct answer, Root cause (knowledge/grammar/interpretation/careless/timing), Fix (what you'll practice).
- Daily habit: after any practice set, log every wrong answer within 30 minutes.
- Weekly habit: aggregate errors; compute:
  - Accuracy % per question type
  - Average time per passage
  - % careless errors
- Weekly reflection: set 2–3 measurable micro-goals (e.g., reduce VOC errors from 60% to 40% wrong; cut reading time per long passage from 12 to 10 minutes).

Measurable metrics to track
- Weekly Reading accuracy % and Writing accuracy %.
- Time per long passage (minutes).
- Number of careless errors per test.
- Cumulative study hours (target 15–25 official practice hours + rule drills across 4 weeks).

## 7) Key risks and mitigation strategies

1. Burnout (too many long sessions)
   - Mitigation: schedule one light day per week (Day 26 in plan). Use Pomodoro (25/5) for long sessions. Sleep and nutrition prioritized. Reduce study time in last 48 hours before final test.

2. Poor pacing (rushing or lingering on items)
   - Mitigation: practice with strict timed sections; keep a visible pacing chart (minutes per passage). Train a “first pass” and “second pass” strategy: answer easy questions first, mark hard ones for later.

3. Over-practice without reflection (doing questions repeatedly without learning)
   - Mitigation: mandatory error-log + 15–30 minute review after each session. After each wrong answer, write a one-line rule or explanation to convert it into a durable memory.

4. Narrow practice (only one resource)
   - Mitigation: backbone of Khan Academy + Meltzer for rules + UWorld for explanations + official CB tests for calibration. Rotate resources weekly.

5. False confidence from untimed practice
   - Mitigation: enforce strict timed practice for sections and full tests once per week. Treat untimed work only as initial learning; always re-test under time constraints.

6. Over-correction (chasing rare error types)
   - Mitigation: prioritize remediation by frequency and point impact (focus on the top 2–3 error categories that cost the most points weekly).

## 8) Final recommendation (core pairing)
- Official core (1): Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy — use as the daily/adaptive core for official-aligned practice, analytics, and progress tracking.
- Educational core (1): Erica L. Meltzer — The Critical Reader + The Ultimate Guide to SAT Grammar — use for deterministic rules, passage-mapping, and grammar taxonomy to convert mistakes into mastered skills.

Why this pairing?
- Khan Academy supplies official item types and personalized practice so your limited time is used where it yields the largest score improvements.
- Meltzer supplies the structured, high-yield frameworks (reading taxonomies + grammar rules) that let you interpret KA feedback and fix errors permanently.
- Add College Board weekly official tests for calibration and use UWorld or PrepScholar selectively for deeper explanations or quick rule refreshers.

If you want next:
- I can produce a printable 30‑day calendar (day-by-day checklist with exact tasks and time blocks in a table or PDF) tailored to a 60‑ or 120‑minute daily window.
- I can also make a one‑page error-log template and a Meltzer‑based prioritized grammar checklist ready for daily flashcards.

Which would you like me to build next?
