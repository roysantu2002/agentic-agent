## 2) Integration guide — how to combine best practices into a unified plan by topic area

Goal: For each major SAT Math domain show what to practice, which resource to use first, and how to measure progress.

- Algebra (Linear equations, inequalities, functions — “Heart of Algebra”)
  - First use: Khan Academy diagnostic modules to identify specific algebra weaknesses; watch short videos for any shaky fundamentals.
  - Drill & explain: UWorld sets for medium/hard algebra questions + detailed error review.
  - Speed practice: 20–30 minute timed no‑calculator drills from Official College Board no‑calc sections and selective Dr. John Chung problems.
  - Strategy: Apply PWN techniques for common traps (e.g., isolating variables quickly, using substitution, rewriting linear expressions).
  - Measure: Weekly timed set accuracy and average time/question; reduce conceptual errors to <10% of misses.

- Problem Solving & Data Analysis (ratios, percentages, proportional reasoning, data interpretation)
  - First use: Khan Academy modules for ratios/percents and data interpretation practice.
  - Drill & explain: UWorld problem sets focusing on multi-step word problems and charts/tables.
  - Speed practice: Official practice items (section subsets) under timed conditions; 10–15 minute quick-drill sets on ratio/percent transformations.
  - Strategy: Memorize common conversions and mental math shortcuts in PWN; keep a short cheat-sheet of fast percent tricks.
  - Measure: Correct approach on 80–90% of multi-step data problems by Week 3.

- Advanced Math (quadratics, exponents, polynomials, functions — “Passport to Advanced Math”)
  - First use: Khan Academy’s advanced algebra modules to reinforce function concepts and transformations.
  - Drill & explain: UWorld for applied quadratic and function questions, with careful review of error reasoning.
  - Speed practice: Targeted Dr. John Chung drills (select 20 problems per week) to build formula recall and routine algebraic manipulation speed.
  - Strategy: Use PWN shortcuts for factoring, completing the square, and recognizing structure; practice function notation conversions.
  - Measure: Reduce algebra-manipulation errors and hit target time per hard question (e.g., 2–3 min on tougher Passport items).

- Geometry (coordinate geometry, plane geometry basics)
  - First use: Khan Academy geometry modules for area/perimeter/angles and coordinate slope/intercept reminders.
  - Drill & explain: UWorld geometry item sets for applied coordinate/plane geometry with diagrams.
  - Speed practice: Official geometry items under mixed-timing (both no‑calc and calc sections) and selected Dr. John Chung speed drills.
  - Strategy: Use quick analytic geometry checks (slope/intercept method) and memorize standard formulas; keep sketches minimal and accurate.
  - Measure: Accurate figure interpretation and coordinate problem solving under timed conditions.

Integration tips (daily):
- Start each session with 30–60 minutes of Khan Academy targeted work (concept review + practice).  
- Follow with 30–45 minutes of UWorld practice sets or PWN strategy reading and immediate application.  
- Add a 20–40 minute timed drill (from official sections or Dr. John Chung) to build speed.  
- End with 15–25 minutes of error review and updating your error log/flashcards.

## 4) 4‑Week Math Preparation Roadmap (daily & weekly focus)

Assumptions
- Total daily study time: 2.5–4 hours/day recommended. If you have less time, reduce each block proportionally (I can tailor a 2‑hour/day plan on request).
- Format: Weekends used for longer timed practice and review.
- Tools: stopwatch/timer, notebook or spreadsheet error log, official PDFs for timed sections, Khan Academy account, UWorld subscription (if chosen), PWN book or blog, Dr. John Chung book (optional).

Week 0 (Day 0) — Quick prep (optional)
- Create error log template and set up Khan Academy account; collect official test PDFs and note exam rules (calculator/no-calculator).

Week 1 — Concept review + diagnostic baseline (Days 1–7)
- Day 1: Diagnostic (Official)  
  - Task: Take 1 official SAT Math section under timed conditions (use a real College Board Math section—ideally both no‑calc and calc across two short sessions across Day 1–2 if time allows). Time strictly, simulate test conditions. Record raw score and time per question.
  - Post-test: Do not immediately reattempt problems. Log all wrong/slow questions into error log with topic tags.
- Days 2–3: Core concept reset — Algebra & Data  
  - 45–60 min: Khan Academy targeted modules on identified weak algebra topics. Complete video(s) + practice items.  
  - 30–40 min: UWorld targeted set for those topics (or PWN chapter for technique if no UWorld). Carefully read solutions.  
  - 20–30 min: Timed no‑calc drills (official easy–medium items).  
  - 20 min: Error log review + create 6–10 flashcards (formulas, traps).
- Days 4–5: Advanced Math basics (quadratics, functions)  
  - 45–60 min KA advanced algebra modules + practice.  
  - 30–40 min UWorld practice (focused).  
  - 20–30 min targeted Dr. John Chung timed drills (selected).
  - 20 min: Error log update.
- Days 6–7: Geometry & Data interpretation  
  - 45–60 min KA geometry modules.  
  - 30–40 min UWorld or PWN geometry problem application.  
  - 20–30 min timed mixed drills (official problems).  
  - End of Week 1: Summary review — categorize errors into Conceptual / Computational / Misread / Timing. Set 3 priority topics for Week 2.

Week 2 — Topic-specific drills + formula retention (Days 8–14)
Goal: Build targeted fluency on 2–3 priority weaknesses from Week 1.

Daily micro-structure (approx. 2.5–3.5 hours)
- 45–60 min: Khan Academy — concentrated module(s) on priority topics. Aim to master 2 levels per day.
- 35–45 min: UWorld practice set (targeted). Focus on explanation comprehension; annotate error log.
- 30 min: Dr. John Chung timed drill (20 problems) or official item set (no‑calc practice).
- 20 min: PWN reading (1 strategy topic) + apply method to 5 practice problems.
- 20–30 min: Review mistakes, flashcards, and spaced repetition.

Weekly tests
- End of Week 2 (Day 14): Take an official timed Math section (or two sections across day) to measure progress. Compare timing and error categories to Week 1.

Week 3 — Timed section practice + systematic error analysis (Days 15–21)
Goal: Shift from concept building to accuracy under time pressure and reduce careless errors.

Daily micro-structure (2.5–4 hours)
- 30–45 min: Short KA warmup (mixed topics — stamina). Keep it mixed to mimic test.
- 60 min: Timed mixed question block (official mixed set or UWorld custom set — 20–25 questions under timed rules). Treat like test segment.
- 30–45 min: Deep error review for that timed block (rework each missed/slow question). Update error log, write corrective steps.
- 20–30 min: Targeted Dr. John Chung speed work (short timed bursts, e.g., 10–15 minutes) to build automaticity.
- 20 min: PWN quick strategy refresh on a trap type you saw often.

Weekly tests
- Midweek: Timed official Math section (strict timing).  
- End of Week 3: Take one official full Math section as a checkpoint. Use score & error log to plan Week 4 focus.

Week 4 — Full mock tests + strategy refinement (Days 22–30)
Goal: Simulate test conditions, finalize pacing & strategy, and correct last recurring errors.

Schedule
- Days 22, 24, 26, 28: Take four sessions that are full official Math sections or full official practice tests (include at least two complete Math sections under test conditions across a few days). If time permits, do two full SAT practice tests (split across days) for realism.
- On each test day:
  - Immediately log all errors into the log (topic and error type).
  - Spend 45–90 minutes reviewing every missed question with UWorld/KA explanations and PWN method where applicable.
- Off days (Days 23, 25, 27, 29): Active remediation
  - 30–45 min KA practice on specific weak points.
  - 30–45 min targeted UWorld practice & error-log re‑exposure.
  - 20–30 min Dr. John Chung micro-timed sets for stamina.
- Final days (Days 29–30):
  - Day 29: Light practice — 30–45 min review of formula/strategies (flashcards + PWN cheat-sheet). Rest and sleep well.
  - Day 30: Light warmup (20–30 min), mental preparation, no heavy drilling.

Daily reflection & monitoring (every day)
- Record: total time studied, topics practiced, score/time for timed sets, error types.
- Weekly snapshot: compare raw/converted scores on Math section to baseline; check if time per question decreased and if conceptual errors decreased.

---

## 5) Performance monitoring & reflection cycle (simple templates)

Error log fields (daily)
- Date | Question ID / source | Topic tag | Mistake type (conceptual / arithmetic / misread / pacing) | Correct method | Action (KA lesson / UWorld review / PWN technique) | Recheck date

Weekly reflection (short)
- Baseline score vs current score (Math section)  
- Top 3 recurring error types and corrective steps  
- Time per question trend (improving / stable / worse)  
- Next week’s 3 practice goals

Timed-test debrief (use after each official test)
- List every missed question, classify, re-solve and write a 1‑sentence rule to avoid repeat mistakes.

---

## 6) Key risks and mitigation strategies

- Risk: Over‑practice fatigue and burnout (too many hours)  
  - Mitigation: Use the 50/10 rule (50 min study, 10 min break), include at least one light day per week, limit heavy timed practice to 2–3 sessions/week after Week 2. Prioritize quality of review over sheer volume.

- Risk: Formula overload — trying to memorize too many heuristics at once  
  - Mitigation: Build a 1‑page master “cheat‑sheet” of 8–12 highest‑value formulas/shortcuts (algebraic identities, quadratic formula, circle area rules, slope/intercept, percent conversions). Use spaced repetition (5–10 min daily).

- Risk: Poor timing/pacing — finishing too few questions or rushing and losing accuracy  
  - Mitigation: Practice timed sections weekly with strict timing; train a pacing plan (e.g., first pass easy items in 20 minutes, then medium items, save 8–10 minutes for hard items). Use PWN tactics to quickly triage questions.

- Risk: Not addressing root cause of repeated mistakes — repeating same errors  
  - Mitigation: Use an error log with corrective action and mandatory re‑test of a similar question type within 72 hours. Use UWorld explanations or KA videos for conceptual root cause.

- Risk: Using non‑aligned drills (e.g., problems too far above/below SAT difficulty)  
  - Mitigation: Prioritize College Board official items, KA items mapped to SAT, and UWorld items that indicate SAT‑aligned difficulty. Use Dr. John Chung selectively for timed volume only.

## 7) Final recommendation — Core resources (pick 1 official + 1 educational)

Primary official resource (Official)
- College Board — Official SAT Practice Tests & Test Specifications  
  - Why: Exact match to real test content and difficulty; essential for baseline diagnostics and end-of-month simulation.

Primary educational resource (Educational)
- Khan Academy — Official SAT Practice  
  - Why: Free, personalized diagnostic + short videos + practice aligned to College Board. Use as the daily engine for concept repair, guided practice, and tracking progress.

Secondary supplements (pick based on budget/needs)
- If you want deep answer explanations + analytics: UWorld SAT (paid). Use for accuracy improvements and explanation-driven remediation.
- If you want strategy and quick heuristics: PWN the SAT (book/blog). Use for PWN tactics and mental shortcuts.
- If you need volume and speed drills: Dr. John Chung’s 1000 Problems (use selectively, timed).

## 8) Quick checklist to start TODAY (actionable)

1. Day 0: Download 1 official College Board Math section PDF. Create a Khan Academy account. Set up an error log (spreadsheet or notebook).  
2. Day 1: Take official timed Math section. Log results and top 3 topics to fix.  
3. Days 2–7: Follow Week 1 plan (Khan Academy first, then UWorld/PWN, then timed drills). Do daily error‑log updates.  
4. End of Week 1: Reassess and set weekly targets (accuracy %, time/question goals).  
5. End of Week 2 & Week 3: Take timed official section each week to measure progress. Week 4: simulate tests and finalize pacing.

---

## 9) CBSE 10+2 adaptation notes (brief)
- CBSE students usually have strong algebra/calculus exposure; main SAT adjustments are phrasing, multiple-choice strategies, and working without calculus. Focus on:
  - Converting CBSE notation to SAT phrasing (function notation, rates, percent word problems).
  - Practice mental math and no‑calculator strategies (use KA and official no‑calc sections).
  - Emphasize multiple-choice elimination and trap recognition (PWN/UWorld help).

---

## 10) Closing: Expected gains & next steps
- Typical realistic gains with disciplined 2–3 hours/day for 4 weeks: many students see measurable math score improvements (commonly 30–150 points overall depending on baseline). High CBSE content knowledge + targeted SAT practice often yields faster gains in timing and strategy.
- Next actionable offer: I can convert this into a day‑by‑day hour‑by‑hour 30‑day calendar tailored to your available daily time and current diagnostic score (e.g., 2 hours/day or 3 hours/day). Tell me baseline Math score and daily available hours and I’ll produce that schedule.

If you want the day‑by‑day 30‑day plan now, tell me:
- Current SAT Math baseline score (or raw performance from one official section)  
- Hours available per weekday and weekend day

I’ll convert the roadmap into a precise daily checklist.
