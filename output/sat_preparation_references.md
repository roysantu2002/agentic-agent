## 3) Integration guide — unify best practices into one plan

High-level principle: use Official tests for measurement and calibration; use Khan Academy as the adaptive daily engine; use Meltzer for Reading/Writing technique and UWorld for deep Math error correction; Ivy Global for variety.

Reading (Critical reasoning, comprehension drills, timed practice)
- Daily routine: 1 timed passage (25–30 minutes) OR two 15-minute micro-passages. Always pre-mark the passage (quick skim for structure), annotate main idea, and answer.
- Weekly: 1 full timed Reading section (65 minutes for SAT reading section as practice) + review every wrong answer using official explanations and Meltzer’s method (identify question type, evidence line, trap).
- Tools: Erica Meltzer chapters for method + KA practice problems for adaptive remediation + Official passages for calibration.

Writing (Grammar patterns, sentence structure, editing strategies)
- Daily routine: 20–30 minute focused grammar drill (KA or Meltzer), 15-minute sentence editing practice.
- Weekly: 1 timed Writing & Language section; review errors by rule (subject–verb, parallelism, modifier placement, punctuation).
- Tools: Meltzer for rule lists and practice; KA for digital timed practice and instant feedback.

Math (Concept mastery, problem-solving shortcuts, data analysis)
- Daily routine: 45–60 minutes of topic-based practice (short, focused sets: algebra, problem solving & data, geometry/trig).
- Weekly: Alternate between No-Calculator and Calculator practice; use UWorld for concept-deep problems where errors repeat. Keep a formula sheet and quick-solve technique notes.
- Tools: KA for adaptive practice and concept refresh; UWorld for targeted problem blocks and detailed error analysis; Official test items to confirm alignment.

Error review and feedback loop (daily 15–30 minutes)
- Maintain an error log (spreadsheet or notebook): date, question source, topic, error type (conceptual/careless/misread), correct approach, re-practice date.
- Use spaced repetition: revisit each error 3× before end of week, and the top 20 recurring errors each week.

Test-day simulation best practice
- Simulate test conditions exactly: full silence, only allowed breaks, same timing and materials. Score using official scoring rules.

## 6) Error-log template (simple)
- Columns: Date | Source (College Board/KA/UWorld/Ivy/Meltzer) | Section | Question # | Topic | Error type (conceptual/careless/misread/time) | Correct approach | Re-practice date | Status (fixed / needs work)
- Use daily: add every wrong answer, review 3× weekly.

---

## 7) Key Risks & Mitigation Strategies

- Risk: Burnout from daily high-intensity study
  - Mitigation: Build weekly lighter day (Day 7, Day 21, Day 29). Use 25–50 minute study blocks with 5–10 minute breaks. Prioritize sleep (7–9 hours) and at least one rest evening weekly.

- Risk: Poor pacing on test day (running out of time)
  - Mitigation: Early and repeated timed section practice; practice elimination and target answering order; simulate test-day timings at least 3 times (Day 1, Day 15, Day 30).

- Risk: Test anxiety under pressure
  - Mitigation: Progressive exposure (start with single section timed, then half-tests, then full-tests); daily short mindfulness/visualization (5–10 min); practice under mild stressors (no phone, strict timing) to increase tolerance.

- Risk: Over-emphasis on one section and neglecting others
  - Mitigation: Weekly distribution: at least 40% Math practice if aiming for higher Math; ensure each day includes some Reading/Writing component. Use the error log to force balanced practice.

- Risk: Misalignment because of CBSE → SAT differences (US phrasing, idioms, evidence-based reading)
  - Mitigation: Use Meltzer specifically for SAT language patterns + KA official items for calibration; focus first weeks on format exposure rather than only content.

---

## 8) Measurable progress checkpoints (what to measure)
- Baseline: Day 1 Official test (section scores and subscores)
- Midpoint: Day 15 full test — aim for measurable improvement in at least one section and fewer careless errors.
- Final: Day 30 official simulation — target reaching your goal band or within ~50 points of goal so final test-day polishing is realistic.
- Weekly: track number of repeated errors in error-log; goal is to halve recurring error frequency each week.

---

## 9) Final recommendation — Core resources to use (1 Official + 1 Educational)

- Official (core): College Board — Official SAT Practice tests (PDFs) & The Official SAT Study Guide
  - Why: Only official items provide true calibration for timing, scoring, and real question styles. Use Day 1, Day 15, Day 30 full-lengths and sprinkle official passages throughout.

- Educational (core): Khan Academy Official SAT Practice
  - Why: Free, adaptive, integrated with official items, and designed to deliver a compact, personalized plan—ideal for a compressed 30-day timeline. Use daily KA modules, videos, and mastery tracking as the study engine.

Optional high-value supplements (use if time/money allows)
- Erica Meltzer — for focused Reading/Writing technique and grammar mastery.
- UWorld — for deep Math and problem-explanation practice (especially if aiming to raise Math accuracy quickly).
- Ivy Global — supplementary full-length and sectional practice for variety.

## 10) Quick start checklist (what to do in the first 24 hours)
1. Print or download an official College Board practice test PDF.
2. Create a Khan Academy account and link it to SAT practice.
3. Take Day 1 official diagnostic under timed conditions.
4. Purchase/borrow Erica Meltzer (if possible) and decide on UWorld subscription.
5. Create an error-log (spreadsheet or notebook) and fill in Day 1 errors.
6. Schedule test dates for Day 15 (midpoint) and Day 30 (final simulation).

---

If you want, I can now:
- Build a personalized day-by-day schedule adjusted to a specific baseline diagnostic score and your available daily hours.
- Produce a printable daily checklist and an editable error-log spreadsheet template.
- Create one-week micro-schedules (hour-by-hour) for high-availability or low-availability students.
