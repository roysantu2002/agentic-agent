  description: >
    Conduct a structured, data-driven research study to identify, analyze, and
    document high-demand, future-resilient course themes in spirituality,
    personal development, relationship intelligence, and natural healing for
    2026 and beyond. The objective is to build a clear, verifiable knowledge base
    that guides the creation of scalable, ethical, and high-impact video-based
    courses aligned with evolving human needs, learner intent, and long-term
    educational value.

    The research aims to distinguish structured, teachable, and curriculum-ready
    course opportunities from short-form inspirational content, belief-only
    teachings, or trend-driven spiritual narratives, without making promotional
    endorsements of specific creators, platforms, or belief systems.

    The research must include:
      - Systematic searches across publicly accessible and verifiable sources
        (e.g., video course platforms, creator education ecosystems, global
         search trend analysis, wellness and consciousness market reports,
         learner behavior studies)
      - Use of verified spirituality, personal growth, relationship, and
        healing-related keywords
        (e.g., nervous system regulation, conscious relationships, trauma-informed
         healing, spiritual awakening integration, somatic practices, numerology,
         astrology, mindfulness, energy healing)
      - Exclusion of fear-based, dependency-forming, pseudoscientific, or
        purely belief-driven content lacking practical learning frameworks
      - Manual verification that identified topics support ethical teaching,
        experiential learning, and structured curriculum design
      - Cross-checking to avoid duplicated trends, rebranded concepts, or
        short-lived viral topics without long-term educational relevance

    For each verified course theme or learning domain, document:
      - Core learner pain point or aspiration
      - Psychological, emotional, relational, or spiritual outcomes sought
      - Primary learner audience
        (e.g., beginners, seekers, practitioners, couples, facilitators)
      - Suitability for video-based course delivery
      - Curriculum depth potential
        (introductory, intermediate, mastery-level)
      - Long-term relevance beyond trend cycles
      - Alignment with ethical, responsible, and non-fear-based education
      - Potential for modular programs, certifications, or learning pathways

    The finalized dataset must be categorized into:
      1) Spiritual Growth & Consciousness Development
      2) Emotional Regulation, Trauma Awareness & Inner Healing
      3) Relationship Intelligence & Human Connection
      4) Natural Healing, Mind–Body Practices & Energy Awareness
      5) Purpose, Meaning, and Life Direction Frameworks

    Prioritization methodology must follow:
      - Strength of learner intent and emotional urgency
      - Willingness to pay for structured, guided education
      - Depth and longevity of transformational impact
      - Applicability across cultures, geographies, and age groups
      - Suitability for ethical, scalable, video-based course ecosystems

    Produce a clear, structured analytical report based on the research findings
    that helps educators, creators, institutions, and conscious education leaders
    understand how to design, position, and scale high-impact video courses in
    spirituality, personal development, relationships, and natural healing.

    The report must remain neutral, non-promotional, and insight-driven, avoiding
    belief enforcement while emphasizing verifiable learner needs, curriculum
    structures, ethical boundaries, and long-term educational relevance.

    The report should include:
      - Executive summary of key findings and demand signals
      - Overview of dominant and emerging learning domains
      - Comparative analysis of beginner, intermediate, and mastery-level courses
      - Breakdown of course positioning and delivery models
        (self-paced, guided, practitioner-track, transformational)
      - Observations on ethical considerations and learner responsibility
      - Identified opportunities for curriculum ecosystems, bundles, and
        long-term learning pathways
