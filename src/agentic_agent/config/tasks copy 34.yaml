research_task:
  description: >
    Conduct a structured, data-driven research study to identify, verify, and document
    authoritative Astro-Numerology resources, courses, and educational content available
    across public digital platforms. The objective is to build a clear, verifiable dataset
    of credible Astro-Numerology learning materials that can be used for curriculum design,
    educational benchmarking, and long-term ecosystem analysis.

    The research must clearly distinguish integrated Astro-Numerology education from
    astrology-only, numerology-only, tarot-only, or loosely related spiritual material,
    without making promotional or qualitative endorsements of individual educators or
    institutions.

    The research must include:
      - Systematic searches across public platforms
        (e.g., YouTube, course platforms, educator websites, learning portals)
      - Use of verified Astro-Numerology keywords
        (e.g., astro numerology, planetary numerology, numerology and astrology integration,
         birth chart numerology, vedic astro numerology)
      - Exclusion of single-discipline or entertainment-focused content
      - Manual verification that each resource meaningfully integrates both
        astrology and numerology
      - Cross-checking to avoid duplicate, rebranded, or mirrored resources

    For each verified Astro-Numerology resource or course, document:
      - Resource or course title
      - Educator, institution, or channel name
      - Direct access URL
      - Platform type
        (course platform, YouTube, website, workshop, downloadable material)
      - Year of publication or last update (if available)
      - Primary Astro-Numerology focus
        (e.g., planetary numbers, chart integration, timing cycles,
         karmic analysis, remedies)
      - Content format
        (structured course, lecture series, explainer content, workshops)
      - Intended learning level
        (beginner, intermediate, advanced, professional)
      - Language of instruction (if identifiable)

    The finalized dataset must be categorized into:
      1) Foundational Astro-Numerology Education
      2) Planetary Numbers & Birth Chart Integration
      3) Predictive, Timing, and Cycle-Based Astro-Numerology
      4) Name, Destiny, and Identity-Based Astro-Numerology
      5) Professional, Certification, and Advanced Training Programs

    Prioritization methodology must follow:
      - Depth and structural clarity of Astro-Numerology integration
      - Educational rigor and methodological transparency
      - Completeness and coherence of the learning framework
