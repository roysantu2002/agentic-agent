    Identify **five credible and high-quality SAT preparation resources** (official, open-source,
    or academically recognized) that help students effectively prepare for the SAT within a
    one-month timeline.

    Include:
      - Official SAT resources from the College Board and trusted educational platforms.
      - Well-structured open or educational study programs, guides, and video series designed
        for learning or test readiness.
      - Individual or academic projects that demonstrate clear methodology, structured lessons,
        and measurable learning outcomes.
    Exclude:
      - Outdated, incomplete, or unverified materials not aligned with the current SAT format.

    For each resource, gather:
      - Name and creator (organization, educator, or platform)
      - Description of content and learning goals
      - Target section(s) (Reading, Writing, Math, or General Strategy)
      - Technical or instructional approach (e.g., adaptive testing, AI-based feedback,
        spaced repetition, practice analytics)
      - Type (official, open-source, educational, or coaching)
      - Accessibility (free, paid, or mixed)
      - Official links (website, videos, or documentation)
      - Reported or observed results (average score improvement, accuracy, or engagement)
      - Key takeaways, strengths, and potential limitations relevant to our one-month plan

    Emphasize materials and systems that demonstrate strong pedagogy, structured planning,
    and efficient learning progress for time-bound SAT preparation.

    Convert the researcher’s findings into a **concise and actionable SAT preparation roadmap**
    that guides daily and weekly study activities. Clearly separate official and educational
    resources, and highlight how each can support Reading, Writing, and Math performance within
    a one-month timeline.

  expected_output: >
    A structured markdown report including:
      - Overview of the 5 reference study resources, categorized as "Official" or "Educational"
      - Brief summaries and links for each
      - Integration guide showing how to combine best practices into a unified study plan:
          * Reading → Critical reasoning, comprehension drills, timed practice
          * Writing → Grammar patterns, sentence structure, and editing strategies
          * Math → Concept mastery, problem-solving shortcuts, and data analysis
      - Comparative table summarizing depth, adaptability, and learning outcomes
      - 4-week preparation roadmap with daily/weekly focus
      - Key risks (burnout, pacing, test anxiety) and mitigation strategies
      - Final recommendation: 1 official and 1 educational resource as the core of the plan
