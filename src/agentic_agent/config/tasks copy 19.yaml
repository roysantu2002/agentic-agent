    Conduct a deep, globally informed research study focused on the most respected system design
    interview frameworks, architecture evaluation methods, and communication standards used in
    hiring Senior and Principal Solution Architects. Identify **five highly credible sources**—
    such as technical hiring frameworks from FAANG, enterprise architecture communities, cloud
    certification bodies, system design books, mock interviews, and architecture playbooks—that explain:

      - Core system architecture domains including:
        * Distributed systems and scalability principles
        * Cloud-native architecture patterns (AWS, Azure, GCP)
        * Microservices vs monolith trade-offs and modular architectures
      - System design evaluation models including:
        * Functional and non-functional requirement clarification
        * Capacity planning, availability design, HA/DR planning, fault tolerance
        * Performance optimization, caching strategies, and consistency trade-offs
      - Architecture communication and modeling frameworks including:
        * C4 model, sequence diagrams, component breakdowns, deployment topologies
        * Whiteboarding structure, time-bound communication patterns, and tradeoff articulation
      - Modern architectural reference approaches including:
        * API-led integration, event streaming, message queues, service mesh, and DDD patterns

    Include sources covering:

      - Security, IAM, compliance, privacy, and zero-trust patterns
      - Operational excellence including observability, CI/CD, SRE concepts, and DevOps maturity
      - Architecture governance frameworks, stakeholder alignment, and decision recording (ADR)
      - Mock system design walkthroughs, scoring rubrics, and example reference answers
      - Interview progression roadmaps including mid-level → senior → principal evaluation pathways

    Exclude:
      - Hobby-level content (random whiteboard ideas, unverified design posts, speculative threads)
      - Content lacking reasoning frameworks, rigor, or applied decision methodology

    For each reference collected, gather:

      - Source type (book, cloud certification, interview guide, architect community standard)
      - Architecture domains covered (cloud, integration, distributed systems, security)
      - Methodology style (framework-driven, example-driven, hybrid, enterprise-aligned)
      - Scope (startup, enterprise, global-scale, regulated environments, hybrid cloud)
      - Accessibility (public, paid course, certification, community restricted)
      - Strengths and limitations (depth, practical value, maturity, system relevance)
      - Relevance to live architecture interviews and real-time reasoning demonstration
      - Reliability rating (community adoption, enterprise alignment, modern relevance)
      - Key takeaways applicable to building a repeatable architecture interview strategy

    Emphasize sources demonstrating:

      - Structured system design reasoning frameworks
      - Clear examples of progressive solution evolution under time constraints
      - Real-world tradeoff analysis showcasing scalability, cost, and operational reasoning
      - Playbooks useful for rapid whiteboarding and executive-level articulation
      - A structured progression model (fundamentals → architectural depth → leadership reasoning)

    Senior Solution Architect System Design Research Summary (5+ validated architecture frameworks or sources):

      - A balanced mix of certified cloud architectures, enterprise design frameworks,
        system design handbooks, mock interview references, and industry evaluation guidelines
      - Links to reference sources (platform certifications, books, official frameworks,
        architecture communities, system design repositories)
      - Comparison matrix across:
          * Architecture approaches (microservices, event-driven, modular monolith, serverless)
          * Reasoning methodology (requirements-first, pattern-first, principles-first)
          * Evaluation focus (scaling, security, cost, observability, performance)
      - Notes supporting the creation of a structured architectural interview framework explaining:
          * “How should a senior architect approach a system design interview?”
          * “Which reasoning steps must be demonstrated and in what sequence?”
          * “What architectural considerations differentiate a senior from a principal-level response?”
      - Recommendation of 1–2 architectural communication frameworks and whiteboard templates
        to use as the primary foundation for live interview readiness.
