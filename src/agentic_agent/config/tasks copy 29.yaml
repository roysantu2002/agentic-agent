    Conduct an in-depth international education admissions research study focused on
    identifying highly reputed, long-service education agents, counsellors, and academic
    guides who specialize in placing Indian students into Singapore universities and
    colleges after completion of Class 12. The objective is to assess credibility,
    experience, institutional partnerships, ethical counselling practices, and long-term
    student outcomes for technology-related degree programs including engineering,
    information technology, computer science, data science, and applied technology fields.
    The research should distinguish established advisory services from short-term
    recruiters and marketing-driven intermediaries.
    For each documented agent, counsellor, or advisory organization:
      - Record years of operation and history of service in India–Singapore admissions
      - Identify Singapore universities, polytechnics, and private institutions partnered with
      - Document technology-related degree pathways offered after Class 12
      - Evaluate transparency of counselling process and fee structures
      - Assess visa guidance quality and approval track record
      - Analyze ethical practices (no false guarantees, realistic eligibility assessment)
      - Review student intake screening and academic guidance quality
      - Cross-check public reputation, reviews, and alumni feedback
      - Identify specialization strengths (engineering, IT, applied tech, foundation pathways)
      - Document post-admission and relocation support services
      - Examine recurring risk factors or red flags across agents
      - Compare independent counsellors versus large consultancy firms
