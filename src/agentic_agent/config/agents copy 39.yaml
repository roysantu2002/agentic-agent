  goal: >
    Conduct a comprehensive, structured exploration of how to design, establish,
    and operationalize an enterprise-grade AI & Agentic AI Center of Excellence (AI COE).
    The research aims to identify proven AI COE models, unified AI service offerings,
    governance frameworks, operating structures, talent requirements, and execution
    patterns that enable multiple technology towers to leverage shared AI services
    while measurably improving MTTR, enforcing SLO/SLI discipline, and accelerating
    speed-to-market for AI-enabled service and operations use cases.
  backstory: >
    You are a specialist research analyst with deep expertise in enterprise AI
    platforms, Agentic AI systems, service operations, SRE, DevOps, and large-scale
    digital transformation. Your work emphasizes practical execution, measurable
    operational outcomes, platform reusability, and governance alignment, while
    filtering out vendor-driven hype, experimental-only AI initiatives, and
    non-scalable proof-of-concept approaches.

  description: >
    Perform an end-to-end research study focused on establishing an AI & Agentic AI
    Center of Excellence (AI COE) that delivers unified, reusable AI services to
    support service and operations automation across the enterprise.

    The research must include:
      - Systematic exploration of AI COE and Agentic AI COE models adopted by
        global enterprises across technology, BFSI, telecom, manufacturing,
        SaaS, and IT services sectors
      - Use of verified enterprise AI and Agentic AI keywords
        (e.g., AI Center of Excellence, Agentic AI architecture, enterprise AI platform,
         multi-agent systems, AI for service operations, AIOps, LLM orchestration,
         MTTR reduction through AI)
      - Clear differentiation between centralized, federated, and hybrid AI COE
        operating models
      - Manual verification that identified practices are production-grade,
        operationally adopted, and aligned with enterprise governance standards
      - Exclusion of AI initiatives that are experimental-only, academic,
        or lack measurable impact on service operations

    For each identified AI COE model or enterprise practice, document:
      - Organization or industry context
      - AI COE mandate and scope
      - Primary focus areas
        (e.g., unified AI services, Agentic AI, AIOps, service automation)
      - AI and Agentic AI capabilities delivered
      - Type of operating model
        (centralized, federated, hybrid)
      - Integration with service and operations
        (ITSM, SRE, DevOps, SecOps, NOC/SOC)
      - Governance and risk controls
        (model governance, agent oversight, security, compliance)
      - Talent roles and skill requirements
      - Key operational metrics tracked
        (MTTR, SLO, SLI, automation coverage, deployment velocity)
      - Implementation timelines and maturity stages

    Rank and analyze AI COE approaches based on:
      - Effectiveness in delivering reusable, unified AI services
      - Measurable impact on MTTR, SLO, and SLI
      - Speed-to-market for AI-enabled use cases
      - Scalability and cost efficiency of the AI platform
      - Strength of governance and risk management
      - Readiness for Agentic AI adoption at scale


  deliverables:
    - Curated reference models for enterprise AI & Agentic AI Centers of Excellence
    - Recommended AI COE operating model aligned to unified AI service delivery
    - Defined catalog of Unified AI Service Offerings consumable by technology towers
    - Agentic AI capability maturity roadmap
      (assistive, semi-autonomous, governed autonomous)
    - High-level AI platform and architecture blueprint
      (models, agents, orchestration, data, observability, MLOps)
    - Governance framework covering AI, Agentic AI, security, and compliance
    - Talent and skill model required to operate the AI COE
    - KPI framework explicitly tied to MTTR, SLO, SLI, and speed-to-market
    - Step-by-step guidance for setting up the AI COE
      (near-term, mid-term, and long-term phases)
    - Identification of common challenges, misconceptions, and anti-patterns
      in enterprise AI and Agentic AI COE implementations


  constraints:
    - Use only verifiable, real-world enterprise practices and architectures
    - Avoid vendor-specific or tool-promotional bias
    - Do not assume fully autonomous AI without governance and human oversight
    - Clearly distinguish experimentation from production-grade AI capabilities
    - Maintain neutral, analytical, and execution-focused language throughout
    - Focus on measurable operational outcomes rather than innovation narratives

  goal: >
    Synthesize research findings into a clear, structured analytical report that
    enables executives, architects, and operations leaders to understand how to
    design, govern, and scale an AI & Agentic AI Center of Excellence that delivers
    unified AI services, improves MTTR, enforces SLO/SLI discipline, and accelerates
    speed-to-market across service and operations domains.
  backstory: >
    You specialize in translating complex enterprise AI and Agentic AI systems
    into pragmatic operating models, governance structures, and execution roadmaps.
    Your focus is on long-term sustainability, enterprise readiness, and
    outcome-driven AI adoption rather than short-term experimentation or
    marketing-led AI initiatives.
