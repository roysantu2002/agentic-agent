    Conduct a deep, enterprise-grade comparative research analysis on **Devin.ai** (autonomous
    software engineering agent) and **Kore.ai** (enterprise conversational and automation platform).
    Identify **five credible, authoritative sources**—product documentation, analyst research,
    architectural guides, or expert evaluations—that explain:
      - The best-fit enterprise use cases for each platform
      - Scenarios where each platform provides limited value or should NOT be used
      - Constraints, operational boundaries, governance considerations, and integration complexity
      - Architectural patterns behind autonomous agents vs. enterprise conversational automation

    Include sources that detail:
      - Devin.ai’s autonomous coding capabilities, execution models, guardrails, toolchains,
        DevOps integrations, and engineering workflows
      - Kore.ai’s conversation design studio, workflow automation, NLU/NLP/LLM orchestration,
        enterprise connectors, security architecture, and governance model
      - Limitations and risks such as hallucination, dependency on third-party APIs,
        interpretability, operational stability, and compliance boundaries
      - Integration touchpoints with DevOps pipelines, CI/CD tools, ITSM systems,
        CRMs, ERPs, cloud APIs, knowledge bases, and message/event sources
      - Enterprise readiness: security controls, identity management, audit trails,
        observability, RBAC, tenant isolation, and operational SLAs

    Exclude:
      - Marketing-heavy or unverifiable claims
      - Hobby examples, demos lacking architectural substance
      - Non-enterprise, low-depth technical content

    For each reference collected, gather:
      - Source name/creator (vendor, analyst, expert, enterprise architect)
      - Core scope (autonomous engineering, conversational automation, workflow orchestration, etc.)
      - Target operational domains (DevOps, ITSM, support, engineering workflows, customer service)
      - Technical architecture overview (agent execution model, API ecosystem, plugin/tool structure,
        workflow engine, orchestration framework, governance controls)
      - Type (official documentation, enterprise whitepaper, analyst insight, reference repo)
      - Access level (public, gated, paid)
      - Strengths and limitations with clear examples
      - Reported applicability to enterprise modernization, automation, or engineering acceleration
      - Risks (security, reliability, model drift, over-automation, integration fragility)
      - Key takeaways relevant to enterprise adoption and prioritization

    Emphasize materials demonstrating:
      - Clear boundaries where Devin.ai is inappropriate (e.g., sensitive codebases, regulated pipelines,
        unpredictable autonomy requirements)
      - Clear boundaries where Kore.ai is inappropriate (e.g., deep engineering automation,
        autonomous code execution)
      - Security and compliance implications across both platforms
      - Human-in-the-loop oversight principles
      - Operational complexity when deploying agentic systems into production ecosystems

  expected_output: >
    Enterprise AI Platform Research Summary (5 detailed reference entries):
      - Balanced mix of official vendor documentation, enterprise analyses, and expert insights
      - Direct links to documentation, whitepapers, analyst research, or reference repositories
      - Comparison matrix focusing on strengths, limitations, applicability, and non-applicable scenarios
      - Notes emphasizing when autonomous agents or conversational platforms either improve or
        compromise operational resilience
      - Recommendation of 1–2 foundational references to anchor enterprise decision-making

    Translate the researcher’s findings into a **structured, actionable decision blueprint**
    explaining how Devin.ai and Kore.ai differ across capabilities, enterprise readiness,
    use-case suitability, and architectural constraints. Provide strategic clarity on:
      - When to select Devin.ai for autonomous software engineering workflows
      - When to select Kore.ai for conversational automation, workflow routing, or enterprise integrations
      - When neither platform is appropriate due to risk, complexity, or compliance
      - Overlaps and complementary use patterns across ITSM, DevOps, support, and operational domains
