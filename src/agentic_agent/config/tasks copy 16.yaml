    Conduct a deep, numerology-centered global events research study focused on **universal year
    9** cycles similar to **2025** and **universal year 1** cycles similar to **2026**. Identify
    **five credible, authoritative sources**—year-in-review reports, global news summaries,
    climate/weather reports, historical analyses, or expert numerology commentary—that explain:
      - Major global themes and turning points for selected universal year 9 years (e.g. 2016, 2007,
        1998 and two earlier 9-years)
      - Major global themes and turning points for selected universal year 1 years (e.g. 2017, 2008,
        1999 and two earlier 1-years)
      - Patterns of “good/constructive”, “challenging/crisis”, and “mixed/neutral” events across
        these years
      - Collective emotional tone, humanitarian focus, and “ending vs beginning” energy visible in
        each cycle

    Include sources that detail:
      - Year-in-review summaries of **top world news** (politics, economy, conflicts, peace
        agreements, technology, social movements) for each selected 9-year and 1-year
      - Global or regional **weather and climate** reports highlighting major storms, floods,
        droughts, heat waves, and natural disasters in those years
      - Historical timelines that place key events in chronological order to see build-up and
        release patterns across a year
      - Established **numerology references** explaining:
          * Number 9 meanings: endings, completion, karmic balancing, humanitarianism, release
          * Number 1 meanings: new beginnings, independence, leadership, initiation, pioneering spirit
      - 2025-specific resources summarising the year’s major events so far to understand how it is
        behaving as a universal year 9 and to prepare a bridge into 2026

    Exclude:
      - Gossip or tabloid-style celebrity stories without wider global impact
      - Unsourced conspiracy material or low-credibility blogs with no factual basis
      - Content that does not clearly connect to either:
          * Real-world global events and climate patterns, or
          * Clear numerology interpretations of numbers 9 and 1

    For each reference collected, gather:
      - Source name/creator (news agency, climate organisation, numerologist/author, historian)
      - Core scope (world news, weather/climate, numerology, historical timeline/analysis)
      - Year(s) covered and whether the perspective is global, regional, or country-specific
      - Type (official report, news article, year-in-review, numerology book/article, expert essay)
      - Access level (public, gated, subscription-required)
      - Strengths and limitations including any bias, regional focus, or gaps in coverage
      - Reported applicability to understanding patterns in universal year 9 and universal year 1 cycles
      - Risks (overly speculative claims, narrow regional focus, lack of climate data, numerology
        interpretations without clear logic)
      - Key takeaways relevant to numerology-based world-year reasoning and on-camera explanation

    Emphasize materials demonstrating:
      - Clear **timelines** of major events across a year
      - The balance of constructive vs challenging events in each 9-year and 1-year
      - Interplay between political/economic/social changes and weather/climate intensity
      - Human decision points, turning moments, or “closure vs new beginning” themes that can be
        interpreted through the lens of universal year 9 and 1 energies

  expected_output: >
    Numerology & World Events Research Summary (5+ detailed reference entries and year profiles):
      - Balanced mix of official news/climate documentation, historical reviews, and expert numerology insights
      - Direct links to reference sources, year-in-review pages, climate reports, or numerology material
      - Comparison matrix focusing on:
          * Repeating themes across universal year 9 cycles
          * Repeating themes across universal year 1 cycles
          * Similarities and differences between 9-years and 1-years
      - Notes capturing reasoning frameworks valuable for explaining:
          * “How was 2025 as a number 9 year?”
          * “What kind of energy may 2026 (number 1) bring based on past patterns?”
      - Recommendation of 1–2 foundational numerology resources on numbers 9 and 1 to anchor
        long-term study and future content creation

    Translate the researcher’s findings into a **structured, video-ready numerology blueprint**
    explaining how universal year 9 (like 2025 and past 9-years) and universal year 1 (like 2026
    and past 1-years) compare in their global patterns, emotional tone, and event themes. Provide
    strategic clarity covering:
      - How universal year 9 tends to manifest: endings, closure, karmic balancing, humanitarian
        focus, emotional intensity, “final exams” before a new cycle
      - How universal year 1 tends to manifest: new beginnings, leadership, innovation, risk-taking,
        “reset” and pioneering energy
      - When certain global patterns (conflict vs cooperation, crisis vs breakthrough) appear more
        prominently in 9-years vs 1-years
      - Overlaps and complementary patterns across 9 and 1 cycles that help narrate the transition
        from 2025 (9) to 2026 (1)

  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive markdown numerology blueprint including:
      - Categorized overview of the main source types (Official News/Reports, Climate/Weather,
        Numerology, Historical/Analytical, Mixed/Case Study)
      - Source summaries including:
          * Applicability to understanding year 9 and year 1 patterns
          * Depth of global vs regional coverage
          * Strength of numerology interpretation (where applicable)
      - Narrative explaining core differences across:
          * Universal year 9 vs universal year 1 emotional tone and collective mood
          * Types of global events that tend to dominate (closures, endings, crises vs launches,
            innovations, new structures)
          * How weather/climate extremes show up across the studied years (where visible)
          * The transition energy from a 9-year to a 1-year cycle
      - A detailed applicability vs non-applicability matrix:
          * For using universal year 9 themes (completion, letting go, humanitarian focus) when
            interpreting global events
          * For using universal year 1 themes (initiation, leadership, courage) when making
            forward-looking statements about 2026
          * Where numerology patterns clearly align with observable trends vs where they are weaker
      - Comparative tables covering:
          * 9-year vs 1-year:
              - Dominant event themes (political, economic, social, technological, humanitarian)
              - Level of conflict vs cooperation
              - Innovation vs closure/cleanup energy
              - Weather/climate intensity patterns (based on collected data)
          * How strongly each researched year expresses the textbook meanings of 9 or 1
      - Adoption rationale:
          * How to use these historical patterns responsibly in a public numerology video
          * How to balance inspiration with realism when speaking about 2026
          * How to encourage viewers to align with 1-year energy (initiative, leadership,
            fresh starts) without fear-based predictions
      - Future-facing considerations:
          * How the 2025→2026 shift may symbolically mark the start of a new 9-year global cycle
          * How themes that peaked in 2025 might seed new beginnings in 2026
          * Suggestions for follow-up videos (e.g. personal year numbers vs universal year 1)
      - Risk and mitigation guidance:
          * Avoiding deterministic or fatalistic language—stressing that numerology shows
            tendencies, not fixed destiny
          * Highlighting that individual experiences depend on personal charts and choices
          * Not overstating correlations where historical data is weak or ambiguous
      - Final recommendation summarizing which patterns anchor:
          * The explanation of “How 2025 behaved as a number 9 year”
          * The prediction narrative “What 2026 as a number 1 year might feel like for the world”
          * 3–5 core themes to emphasise in the 2026 video (e.g. NEW BEGINNINGS, LEADERSHIP,
            INNOVATION, PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, COURAGE TO START)
