    Conduct a deep, enterprise-grade architectural research study focused on modern system design
    patterns, cloud-native engineering models, and distributed system best practices. Identify
    **five credible, authoritative sources**—cloud architecture blueprints, engineering case studies,
    whitepapers, academic research, or expert commentary—that explain:
      - Best-fit use cases for major architectural styles and patterns
      - Scenarios where specific patterns fail or should NOT be used
      - Constraints, scalability considerations, performance trade-offs, and operational complexity
      - Architectural principles behind high-availability, fault tolerance, and global-scale systems

    Include sources that detail:
      - Microservices evolution models (monolith → modular monolith → microservices → event-driven)
      - Distributed communication patterns including REST, gRPC, WebSockets, and event streaming
      - Cloud-native compute models, network strategies, load balancing, and multi-region architectures
      - Messaging and streaming technologies such as Kafka, Pulsar, RabbitMQ, and cloud messaging services
      - Kubernetes deployment models, autoscaling, operators, service mesh, and workload identity security
      - Data architecture patterns including OLTP/OLAP separation, sharding, replication, and federation
      - AI system integration including LLM inference scaling, retrieval-augmented generation,
        vector databases, agent orchestration, and model governance
      - Observability requirements including tracing, metrics, logs, SLIs, SLOs, and chaos testing
      - Enterprise compliance including IAM models, Zero Trust policies, RBAC/ABAC, encryption,
        tenant isolation, governance frameworks, and auditability

    Exclude:
      - Vendor marketing content without technical substance
      - Beginner-level or tutorial-style examples lacking enterprise depth
      - Content without real-world scalability, operational, or architectural reasoning

    For each reference collected, gather:
      - Source name/creator (vendor, expert architect, academic institution, enterprise engineer)
      - Core architectural scope (messaging, compute, distributed systems, orchestration, AI integration)
      - System model overview (architecture diagrams, topology, scaling design, governance model)
      - Type (official reference, engineering blog, academic paper, cloud blueprint, case study)
      - Access level (public, gated, subscription-required)
      - Strengths and limitations including documented trade-offs
      - Reported applicability to real-world enterprise architecture and production systems
      - Risks (scaling failures, operational fragility, data consistency challenges, compliance restrictions)
      - Key takeaways relevant to system design reasoning and interview articulation

    Emphasize materials demonstrating:
      - Architectural trade-offs and constraint-driven decision reasoning
      - System behavior under scale, load, and failure scenarios
      - Real-world examples of production workloads and global distributed architectures
      - Human decision models for when and why specific patterns should be applied

  expected_output: >
    System Design Architecture Research Summary (5 detailed reference entries):
      - Balanced mix of official documentation, enterprise case studies, and expert insights
      - Direct links to reference sources, architecture diagrams, or research material
      - Comparison matrix focusing on strengths, weaknesses, applicability, and failure scenarios
      - Notes capturing reasoning frameworks valuable for live system design articulation
      - Recommendation of 1–2 foundational resources as core study anchors for long-term mastery

    Translate the researcher’s findings into a **structured, interview-ready system design blueprint**
    explaining how different architectural patterns compare in scalability, reliability,
    operational complexity, and enterprise suitability. Provide strategic clarity covering:
      - When to select microservices, modular monolith, event-driven, or hybrid architectures
      - When specific compute, messaging, or data patterns enhance scale—or create unnecessary complexity
      - When certain system design models are inappropriate due to performance, compliance,
        operational burden, or engineering maturity constraints
      - Overlaps and complementary use patterns across cloud-native, distributed, and AI-driven systems

  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive markdown architecture blueprint including:
      - Categorized overview of the five architecture source types (Official, Enterprise, Expert, Academic, Case Study)
      - Source summaries including applicability and architectural depth indicators
      - Narrative explaining core differences across:
          * Execution/runtime models (containerized, serverless, orchestrated, event-driven)
          * Communication patterns (sync vs async models, streaming vs direct calls)
          * Data and storage models (relational, distributed NoSQL, vector, event streams)
          * Deployment strategies (single region, multi-region, edge, hybrid, multi-cloud)
      - A detailed applicability vs non-applicability matrix:
          * Messaging patterns (pub/sub, queues, event streaming, point-to-point)
          * Scaling models (vertical, horizontal, partitioned, multi-tenant)
          * Resilience models (active-active, failover, eventual consistency)
      - Comparative tables covering:
          * Operational complexity
          * Security posture
          * Governance maturity
          * Cost trade-off considerations
          * Tooling and ecosystem support
      - Adoption rationale:
          * Engineering readiness
          * Business requirements alignment
          * Risk tolerance and resilience expectations
