  goal: >
    Conduct a complete, end-to-end research study on the life of Indian film actor
    Vinod Khanna — documenting his journey from cinematic superstardom to radical
    spiritual renunciation and eventual reintegration into public life.

    The objective is to capture Vinod Khanna’s life as a singular, real-world case
    study of success, existential questioning, ego dissolution, surrender, loss,
    discipline, transformation, and return — suitable for deep spiritual,
    psychological, and consciousness-based education.

    This research treats his journey as human, costly, and transformative —
    not symbolic, promotional, or mythological.

    modern Indian spiritual movements, consciousness psychology, and biographical
    analysis. Your work focuses on translating real-life spiritual journeys of

    narratives.
