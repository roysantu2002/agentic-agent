  goal: >
    Conduct a comprehensive, structured exploration of the most demanded and
    emerging course topics in spirituality, personal development, relationships,
    and natural healing for 2026 and beyond, with specific focus on video-based
    learning platforms.

    The research aims to identify scalable, high-intent learning themes aligned
    with evolving human needs—emotional regulation, meaning, connection, healing,
    and self-mastery—while filtering out trend-only, low-retention, or
    non-educational spiritual content.
  backstory: >
    You are a specialist research analyst with deep expertise in consciousness
    education, personal development ecosystems, digital wellness markets, and
    creator-led learning platforms. Your work emphasizes learner intent, long-term
    relevance, ethical spiritual education, and curriculum viability for
    structured video courses rather than short-form inspiration or belief-based
    content alone.


research_task:
  description: >
    Perform an end-to-end research study to identify the top high-demand and
    future-resilient course themes in spirituality, personal growth, relationship
    intelligence, and natural healing that learners are actively seeking through
    video course platforms.

    The research must include:
      - Systematic analysis of global learner intent across video learning
        platforms, search trends, and creator education ecosystems
      - Use of verified keywords and topic clusters
        (e.g., spiritual awakening integration, nervous system regulation,
         conscious relationships, trauma-informed healing, energy psychology,
         numerology, astrology, mindfulness, somatic practices)
      - Differentiation between casual inspirational content and structured,
        teachable course-worthy subjects
      - Validation that topics support curriculum depth, progressive learning,
        and ethical application
      - Exclusion of fear-based, cult-driven, pseudoscientific, or
        purely belief-dependent teachings without practical frameworks

    For each identified course theme, document:
      - Core learner problem or aspiration
      - Emotional, psychological, or spiritual outcome sought
      - Primary audience segment
        (e.g., beginners, practitioners, professionals, seekers, couples)
      - Course viability for video-based learning
      - Depth potential
        (introductory, intermediate, mastery-level)
      - Long-term relevance beyond trend cycles
      - Compatibility with certification, programs, or modular learning paths

    Identify and validate at least 15 high-demand course topics based on:
      - Search intent and learning demand
      - Emotional urgency and life relevance
      - Willingness to pay for structured education
      - Retention and transformational depth
      - Applicability across cultures and geographies
      - Suitability for ethical, responsible teaching


  deliverables:
    - Curated list of Top 15 high-demand course topics for 2026 and beyond
    - Learner intent map linking emotional needs to course themes
    - Topic-to-curriculum depth assessment
      (short course, flagship program, mastery pathway)
    - Recommended course positioning
      (self-paced, guided, practitioner-track, transformational)
    - Content differentiation guidance to avoid commoditized spirituality
    - Long-term curriculum ecosystem opportunities
      (bundles, pathways, certifications, mentorship)


  constraints:
    - Focus on ethical, responsible, and grounded spiritual education
    - Avoid fear-based, predictive, or dependency-forming narratives
    - Do not assume belief without experiential or practical frameworks
    - Distinguish healing education from medical or clinical treatment claims
    - Maintain neutral, research-driven, learner-first language
    - Prioritize long-term value over short-term virality
