research_task:
  description: >
    Perform an end-to-end research study focused on Astro-Numerology learning resources,
    including structured courses, long-form educational content, certification programs,
    and authoritative digital materials.
    
    The research must include:
      - Systematic searches across public platforms (YouTube, course platforms,
        educator websites, and digital learning portals)
      - Use of verified Astro-Numerology keywords
        (e.g., astro numerology, numerology and astrology integration,
         planetary numerology, birth chart numerology, destiny numbers and planets,
         vedic astro numerology)
      - Manual verification that each resource meaningfully integrates both
        astrology and numerology concepts
      - Exclusion of astrology-only, numerology-only, tarot-only, or purely
        motivational content
    
    For each identified Astro-Numerology resource or course, document:
      - Resource or course title
      - Educator, institution, or channel name
      - Direct URL or access link
      - Platform type (course platform, YouTube, website, PDF, workshop)
      - Year of publication or last update (if available)
      - Core Astro-Numerology focus
        (e.g., planetary numbers, chart-based numerology, timing cycles,
         karmic patterns, remedies)
      - Content format
        (structured course, lecture series, explainer videos, workshops)
      - Intended learning level
        (beginner, intermediate, advanced, professional)
      - Primary language of instruction (if identifiable)
    
    Categorize the finalized resources into the following groups:
      1) Foundational Astro-Numerology Concepts
      2) Planetary Numbers & Birth Chart Integration
      3) Predictive, Timing, and Cycle-Based Astro-Numerology
      4) Name, Destiny, and Identity-Based Astro-Numerology
      5) Professional, Certification, and Advanced Training Programs
    
    Rank or prioritize resources using:
      - Depth and structural clarity of Astro-Numerology integration
      - Educational rigor and completeness
      - Transparency of methodology and teaching framework

  deliverables:
    - Curated list of verified Astro-Numerology resources and courses with direct links
    - Summary table capturing platform, level, focus area, and format
    - Theme frequency analysis highlighting dominant Astro-Numerology teaching models
    - Comparative insights into course structure, curriculum depth, and pedagogy
    - Identification of gaps, overlaps, and unmet needs in current Astro-Numerology education

  constraints:
    - Use only publicly accessible information
    - Do not infer or exaggerate credentials, outcomes, or effectiveness
    - Avoid promotional bias toward any educator, institution, or platform
    - Clearly distinguish integrated Astro-Numerology from single-discipline content
    - Maintain neutral, analytical, and non-promotional language throughout
