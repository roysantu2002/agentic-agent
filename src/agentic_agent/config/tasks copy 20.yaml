    Conduct a deep, globally informed numerology research study focused on the most respected
    numerology systems, teaching frameworks, lineage traditions, and applied interpretation models
    used by professional numerologists worldwide. Identify **five highly credible sources**—such as
    classical numerology texts, master numerologists, certified numerology schools, Vedic astrology

        * Karmic debt numbers and hidden corrective patterns
      - Primary numerology chart systems including:
        * Life Path, Destiny/Expression, Soul Urge, Personality, and Maturity numbers
        * Name numerology and alphabet-to-number conversion systems
        * Birth chart construction across different lineages
      - Multilevel numerology interpretation models including:
        * Personality analysis and soul purpose decoding
        * Relationship, marriage, and partnership compatibility

      - Health, energy frequencies, and vibrational number medicine
      - Geo-numerology (property, vehicle, address, and spatial numbers)
      - Advanced cross-lineage fusion and comparative numerology methodologies

    Exclude:
      - Superficial, entertainment-only numerology content
      - Unverified social media interpretations and anecdotal-only systems
      - Sources lacking mathematical structure, historical grounding, or repeatable methodology

    For each reference collected, gather:

      - Source type (classical text, master teacher, certification body, modern school, research publication)
      - Numerology lineage covered (Pythagorean, Chaldean, Vedic, Chinese, or hybrid)
      - Teaching methodology (formula-driven, symbolic, predictive, corrective, hybrid)
      - Scope (personal guidance, business use, spiritual development, global forecasting)
      - Accessibility (public book, paid course, certification, private lineage)
      - Strengths and limitations (interpretive depth, mathematical rigor, applicability)
      - Relevance to professional numerology practice and certification use
      - Reliability rating (lineage credibility, practitioner adoption, global recognition)
      - Key takeaways applicable to building a **100-topic structured numerology curriculum**

    Emphasize sources demonstrating:

      - Clear calculation systems with repeatable outcomes
      - Progressive learning from foundational to master-level interpretation
      - Real-world case studies and predictive validation
      - Professionally teachable frameworks suitable for certification programs
      - A structured mastery progression (Foundation → Practitioner → Master Analyst)
