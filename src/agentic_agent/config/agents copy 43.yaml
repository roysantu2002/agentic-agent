  goal: >
    Conduct a comprehensive, structured exploration of Crystal Healing
    as a grounded, ethical, and curriculum-ready consciousness education
    domain for 2026 and beyond.

    The objective is to design a complete Crystal Healing course ecosystem
    suitable for long-form, video-based education—focused on experiential
    awareness, self-regulation, subtle perception, and conscious integration,
    rather than belief-based, fear-driven, or commercialized crystal narratives.

    The research emphasizes Crystal Healing as a self-awareness and
    consciousness-support modality—not a replacement for medical,
    psychological, or professional care.
  backstory: >
    You are a specialist research analyst with deep expertise in subtle energy
    systems, contemplative education, consciousness psychology, and ethical
    spiritual pedagogy. Your work focuses on translating ancient energetic
    frameworks and modern awareness practices into structured, learner-safe,
    experience-based curricula with long-term relevance and integrity.


research_task:
  description: >
    Perform an end-to-end research and curriculum design study to identify,
    validate, and structure a complete Crystal Healing Course aligned with
    Spiritual Growth & Consciousness Development.

    The study must position Crystal Healing as:
      - A consciousness-support and self-awareness modality
      - A practice of energetic sensitivity, presence, and inner regulation
      - A non-dogmatic, experience-first learning system
      - An ethical, learner-responsible educational pathway

    The research must include:
      - Systematic analysis of global learner intent toward crystals,
        energy healing, and subtle body awareness
      - Differentiation between commercial crystal content and
        curriculum-ready crystal healing education
      - Integration of crystals with consciousness, mindfulness,
        nervous system awareness, and embodied presence
      - Validation of crystal healing as a teachable, progressive,
        long-term practice suitable for structured video learning
      - Exclusion of fear-based claims, medical promises, superstition,
        or dependency-oriented narratives

    The course must be designed as a scalable learning ecosystem
    (introductory → practitioner → mastery → integration).
