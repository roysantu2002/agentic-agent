    Conduct a deep, globally informed numerology research study focused on the most respected
    frameworks, systems, teaching styles, and knowledge structures used by professional
    numerologists and established numerology schools. Identify **five highly credible sources**—
    such as master numerologists, accredited numerology schools, classical texts, modern certification
    programs, and respected teaching methodologies—that explain:

      - Core numerology foundations including:
        * Single-digit numbers (1–9)
        * Master numbers (11, 22, 33)
        * Karmic numbers (13, 14, 16, 19)
      - Predictive numerology systems including:
        * Personal Year, Personal Month, Personal Day
        * Pinnacles, Cycles, and Challenges
        * Life Path progressions and maturity numbers
      - Chart construction and interpretation frameworks:
        * Name charts (Expression, Soul Urge, Personality, Growth)
        * Date of birth profile & core blueprint
        * Missing and repeated numbers and their meanings
      - Eastern and Western numerology systems including:
        * Pythagorean System
        * Chaldean System
        * Vedic / Lo Shu / Chinese numerology grid models

    Include sources exploring:

      - Compatibility and relationship numerology frameworks
      - Behavioral mapping frameworks such as Planes, Arrows, Character Signatures
      - Chart correction systems (name adjustments, business numerology)
      - Case studies, real readings, and teaching styles used in professional courses
      - Certification structures including beginner → practitioner → master level pathways

    Exclude:
      - Non-source material (social media memes, unverified blogs, hobbyist numerology opinion)
      - Content lacking structured methodology or interpretive consistency

    For each reference collected, gather:

      - Source author/institution (school, author, lineage, or organization)
      - Historical basis (traditional, modern adaptation, hybrid system)
      - Type (textbook, certification curriculum, video course, case study archive, classical scripture)
      - Scope (western, eastern, global, blended methodology)
      - Accessibility (open, tuition-based, textbook only, closed certification system)
      - Strengths and limitations (depth, applicability, consistency, cultural bias)
      - Relevance to a modular online mastery program and applied chart interpretation
      - Reliability rating (based on lineage, adoption, structure, clarity)
      - Methodological takeaways applicable to teaching a modern certification-based numerology course

    Emphasize sources demonstrating:

      - Step-by-step chart interpretation methods
      - Clear frameworks for teaching personal year and cycle forecasting
      - Applied numerology through real examples and case interpretations
      - A structured learning process from foundations → applied → mastery → professional readings
      - A balance between spiritual philosophy and practical application

  expected_output: >
    Numerology Mastery Research Summary (5+ validated numerology frameworks or sources):

      - A balanced mix of historical numerology lineages, modern certification courses,
        practitioner methodologies, and applied chart-analysis systems
      - Links to reference sources (courses, books, certification bodies, classical texts)
      - Comparison matrix across:
          * System structure (Pythagorean, Chaldean, Lo Shu, Modern Western)
          * Teaching methodology (theoretical, intuitive, case-driven, blended)
          * Topics covered (core numbers, name change numerology, compatibility, forecasting)
      - Notes supporting the creation of a professional numerology course explaining:
          * “What knowledge must a professional numerologist possess?”
          * “How should the material be sequenced for progressive learning?”
          * “Which systems can be integrated vs. kept separate for clarity?”
      - Recommendation of 1–2 foundational numerology systems and teaching frameworks to use
        as the primary core structure for the Mastery Course.
