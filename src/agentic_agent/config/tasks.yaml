    Perform comprehensive research required to design a complete
    Full-Stack AI-Enabled Developer course.

    Research areas include:
      - Python programming for backend systems
      - REST API fundamentals and best practices
      - FastAPI: async programming, dependency injection, background tasks,
        validation, OpenAPI, and performance
      - Databases: SQL, NoSQL, ORMs, migrations, and data modeling
      - Authentication & authorization (JWT, OAuth, RBAC)
      - Next.js frontend architecture (routing, SSR/SSG, server/client components)
      - Frontend-backend integration patterns
      - Cloud APIs and managed services
      - AI/LLM integration using cloud-based APIs
      - Retrieval-Augmented Generation and tool-based AI workflows
      - Observability, logging, testing, and performance tuning
      - DevOps: Docker, CI/CD, environments, and deployment strategies
      - Security, cost control, and scalability considerations

    For each topic, gather:
      - Official documentation and credible references
      - Core concepts and architectural patterns
      - Common pitfalls and best practices
      - Prerequisites and skill dependencies
      - Real-world implementation guidance

    Emphasize:
      - Production-ready engineering practices
      - API-first and cloud-first system design
      - Responsible and maintainable AI integration

  expected_output: >
    Full-Stack AI Research Reference Corpus:
      - Categorized research by backend, frontend, AI, cloud, and DevOps
      - Curated official and credible learning references
      - Extracted system design and implementation patterns
      - Skill dependency and progression mapping
      - Identification of core vs advanced topics
