    Conduct a comprehensive, medically responsible research study on Peyronie’s disease.
    The objective is to document the condition end-to-end—from definition and causes to
    diagnosis, progression, and complete treatment guidance—so the material can be used
    for patient education and integrative health reference.
    The research must clearly distinguish between evidence-based medical treatments,
    supportive lifestyle measures, natural/home approaches, and Ayurvedic perspectives,
    without making prescriptive medical claims.
    The research must include:
      - Medical definition and overview of Peyronie’s disease
      - Epidemiology and prevalence patterns
      - Etiology and risk factors (microtrauma, genetics, comorbidities)
      - Pathophysiology (fibrosis, plaque formation, curvature mechanics)
      - Disease stages (acute/inflammatory vs chronic/stable)
      - Common symptoms and red-flag symptoms
      - Diagnostic process (history, examination, imaging, scoring tools)
      - Natural history and prognosis
      - Psychological, sexual, and relationship impact
    Treatment research must be structured under the following categories:
      1) Evidence-Based / Conventional Treatments
         - Observation and watchful waiting
         - Oral therapies (with evidence limitations)
         - Intralesional injection therapies
         - Mechanical therapies (traction, vacuum devices)
         - Surgical interventions (indications, techniques, risks, outcomes)
      2) Lifestyle & Supportive Care
         - Sexual activity guidance
         - Pain management strategies
         - Mental health and counseling considerations
      3) Natural & Home-Based Approaches
         - Diet and anti-inflammatory practices
         - Supplements commonly discussed (with evidence grading)
         - Home-based supportive measures and safety boundaries
      4) Ayurvedic Perspective
         - Ayurvedic interpretation (dosha and dhatu involvement)
         - Commonly referenced herbs, formulations, and therapies
         - Traditional rationale vs modern scientific evidence
         - Contraindications, interactions, and safety cautions
      5) Practices to Avoid
         - Unsafe self-treatment methods
         - Misinformation and exaggerated cure claims
    Each treatment category must explicitly state:
      - Strength of scientific evidence
      - Expected benefits and limitations
      - Risks and side effects
      - Clear guidance on when urologist consultation is mandatory
    Ethical framing must emphasize:
      - Peyronie’s disease as a medical condition, not a personal failing
      - The importance of professional diagnosis and supervision
      - Integrative approaches as complementary, not substitutes

    Create a clear, compassionate, patient-friendly educational guide titled:
    "Peyronie’s Disease: Understanding Causes, Progression, and Treatment Options".
    Transform the research into an easy-to-understand manual that helps patients and
    caregivers comprehend the condition, evaluate treatment options rationally, and
    approach care decisions safely and ethically.
    The guide must avoid fear-based language and false guarantees, while empowering
    readers with clarity and realistic expectations.
    The guide should include:
      - Plain-language explanation of Peyronie’s disease
      - Visual-style step-by-step explanation of disease progression
      - Diagnosis and staging explained simply
      - Treatment options organized by disease stage
      - Clear separation of medical treatments vs supportive approaches
      - Natural and Ayurvedic perspectives with evidence disclaimers
      - When to seek immediate or specialist care
      - Emotional, sexual health, and relationship guidance
      - Common myths, mistakes, and unsafe practices to avoid
