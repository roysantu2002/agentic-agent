  description: >
    Conduct a structured, data-driven research study to identify, analyze, and
    document curriculum-ready frameworks for Spiritual Growth & Consciousness
    Development. The objective is to build a clear, verifiable knowledge base
    that directly supports the design of detailed course outlines, lesson
    structures, experiential practices, and integration pathways for
    long-form, video-based spiritual education.

    The research aims to distinguish structured consciousness-development
    education from inspirational content, belief-only teachings, or loosely
    defined awakening narratives, without promoting specific traditions,
    teachers, or ideologies.

    The research must include:
      - Systematic analysis of established and contemporary
        consciousness-development models
        (e.g., awareness training, observer consciousness, self-inquiry,
         ego maturation, non-dual foundations, integration-based spirituality)
      - Review of successful long-form spiritual education programs and
        consciousness training formats
      - Use of verified learning constructs and instructional language
        (e.g., stages of consciousness, presence stabilization, identity
         deconstruction, embodiment, integration)
      - Exclusion of dogmatic, fear-based, predictive, or guru-dependent systems
      - Manual verification that frameworks translate into structured lessons,
        practices, reflections, and learner integration safeguards
      - Cross-checking to avoid rebranded concepts or non-instructional
        spiritual abstractions

    For each verified framework or learning domain, document:
      - Core consciousness skill or awareness capacity being developed
      - Learning objectives and internal shifts at each stage
      - Learner readiness level
        (foundational, intermediate, advanced, integration)
      - Lesson sequencing and pacing recommendations
      - Experiential components
        (guided practices, inquiry exercises, reflection, journaling)
      - Daily-life integration requirements
      - Ethical boundaries and psychological grounding considerations

    The finalized dataset must be categorized into:
      1) Foundations of Awareness & Presence
      2) Identity, Ego Structures & Observer Consciousness
      3) Stages of Spiritual Development & Maturity
      4) Integration of Awakening into Daily Life
      5) Long-Term Conscious Living & Inner Stability

    Prioritization methodology must follow:
      - Teachability and clarity of the framework
      - Depth and stability of learner transformation
      - Safety, grounding, and ethical responsibility
      - Cultural neutrality and belief independence
      - Capacity to support multi-level course architecture
        (foundation → advanced → mastery)

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Produce a clear, curriculum-focused analytical report that enables course
    creators and institutions to design, structure, and deliver comprehensive
    video courses in Spiritual Growth & Consciousness Development.

    The report must emphasize progression, embodiment, and integration—ensuring
    learners not only understand consciousness conceptually, but stabilize
    awareness and apply insight in everyday life.

    The report must remain neutral, non-dogmatic, and non-promotional, prioritizing
    experiential learning, learner self-agency, and responsible facilitation.

    The report should include:
      - Executive summary of core consciousness education insights
      - Recommended end-to-end course blueprint
        (foundation → expansion → integration)
      - Detailed module and lesson templates
      - Guidance on balancing theory, practice, and reflection
      - Integration models for work, relationships, and daily living
      - Ethical teaching boundaries and learner readiness indicators
      - Opportunities for mastery tracks and long-term mentorship pathways


  expected_output: >
    A structured markdown curriculum design and content strategy report containing:
      - Full course blueprint for Spiritual Growth & Consciousness Development
      - Modular lesson outlines with objectives and practices
      - Sample pacing models and weekly learning flows
      - Integration frameworks for sustained awareness embodiment
      - Risk-aware guidance for advanced spiritual instruction
      - Strategic insights for scalable, mastery-based
        consciousness education programs
