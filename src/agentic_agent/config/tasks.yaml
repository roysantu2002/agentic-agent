    Conduct a global, evidence-based research study on well-known public figures who achieved
    high levels of professional success, wealth, fame, and social recognition, yet died by suicide.
    The objective is to analyze how failures in life management, purpose alignment, emotional health,
    and relationship stability contributed despite financial and career success.
    For each documented individual and case category:
      - Identify profession, peak career success, and financial status
      - Document known life struggles (mental health, relationships, isolation, pressure)
      - Analyze gaps in life purpose, emotional well-being, and inner fulfillment
      - Compare professional success versus personal life stability
      - Examine warning signs and overlooked psychological indicators
      - Identify patterns across industries (film, business, sports, tech, music, politics)
      - Contrast life management failures with strong professional, financial, or time management
      - Review psychological, sociological, and behavioral studies supporting these patterns
      - Evaluate how purpose clarity and relationship health correlate with long-term happiness
      - Capture global statistics on suicide among high-performing and high-income individuals
