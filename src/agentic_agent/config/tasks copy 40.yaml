  description: >
    Conduct a structured, data-driven research study to identify, analyze, and
    document curriculum-ready frameworks for Crystal Healing as a component of
    Spiritual Growth & Consciousness Development.

    The objective is to build a clear, verifiable knowledge base that directly
    supports the design of detailed crystal healing course outlines, lesson
    structures, experiential practices, and long-term integration pathways
    suitable for long-form, video-based education.

    The research must clearly distinguish structured, awareness-based crystal
    healing education from inspirational content, belief-only teachings,
    commercialized crystal narratives, or loosely defined energetic claims—
    without promoting specific traditions, healers, belief systems, or ideologies.

    The research must include:
      - Systematic analysis of crystal healing frameworks that can be taught as
        consciousness-support and self-awareness practices
        (e.g., subtle energy awareness, presence-based crystal use, grounding
         practices, emotional regulation support, embodied perception)
      - Review of successful long-form spiritual and energy-awareness education
        programs where crystals are used as integrative tools rather than
        belief-driven objects
      - Use of verified instructional and consciousness-learning constructs
        (e.g., awareness stabilization, energetic sensitivity, nervous system
         grounding, observer presence, embodiment, integration)
      - Exclusion of dogmatic, fear-based, predictive, medical-claim, or
        guru-dependent crystal healing systems
      - Manual verification that each framework can be translated into
        structured lessons, guided practices, reflections, and learner-safe
        integration protocols
      - Cross-checking to avoid rebranded superstition, symbolic-only teaching,
        or non-instructional energetic abstractions

    For each verified crystal healing framework or learning domain, document:
      - Core awareness skill or subtle-energy capacity being developed
      - Learning objectives and internal shifts at each stage of practice
      - Learner readiness level
        (foundational, intermediate, practitioner, integration)
      - Lesson sequencing and pacing recommendations
      - Experiential components
        (guided crystal-based awareness practices, somatic grounding,
         inquiry exercises, journaling, reflective observation)
      - Daily-life integration requirements
        (self-regulation, emotional balance, presence in relationships and work)
      - Ethical boundaries, safety principles, and psychological grounding
        considerations for crystal-based education

    The finalized dataset must be categorized into:
      1) Foundations of Conscious Crystal Healing & Grounding
      2) Subtle Energy Awareness & Observer Presence
      3) Emotional Regulation & Embodied Crystal Practice
      4) Applied Crystal Healing & Facilitation Ethics
      5) Long-Term Integration, Maturity & Conscious Living

    Prioritization methodology must follow:
      - Teachability and experiential clarity of the framework
      - Depth, stability, and sustainability of learner transformation
      - Safety, grounding, and ethical responsibility
      - Cultural neutrality and belief independence
      - Capacity to support multi-level course architecture
        (foundation → practitioner → mastery → integration)

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Produce a clear, curriculum-focused analytical report that enables course
    creators and institutions to design, structure, and deliver comprehensive
    video-based Crystal Healing courses within the broader domain of Spiritual
    Growth & Consciousness Development.

    The report must emphasize progression, embodiment, and integration—ensuring
    learners not only understand crystal healing conceptually, but stabilize
    awareness, regulate inner states, and apply crystal-supported insight in
    everyday life.

    The report must remain neutral, non-dogmatic, and non-promotional, prioritizing
    experiential learning, learner self-agency, ethical facilitation, and
    responsible use of crystals as awareness-support tools.

    The report should include:
      - Executive summary of core crystal healing education insights
      - Recommended end-to-end course blueprint
        (foundation → applied practice → integration)
      - Detailed module and lesson templates
      - Guidance on balancing theory, guided practice, and reflection
      - Integration models for work, relationships, emotional balance,
        and daily living
      - Ethical teaching boundaries, contraindications, and learner
        readiness indicators
      - Opportunities for practitioner certification, mastery tracks,
        and long-term mentorship pathways


  expected_output: >
    A structured markdown curriculum design and content strategy report containing:
      - Full Crystal Healing course blueprint aligned with consciousness development
      - Modular lesson outlines with objectives, practices, and safety notes
      - Sample pacing models and weekly learning flows
      - Integration frameworks for sustained embodiment and inner stability
      - Risk-aware guidance for advanced crystal healing instruction
      - Strategic insights for scalable, mastery-based crystal healing
        education programs
