  description: >
    Conduct a structured, data-driven YouTube research study to identify and document the
    Top 50 most-viewed numerology-related videos currently available on the platform.
    The objective is to compile an accurate, verifiable dataset of high-performing
    numerology content—including direct links and engagement metrics—so the findings can
    be used for content strategy, educational analysis, and trend research.

    The research must clearly distinguish authentic numerology-focused videos from
    astrology-only, tarot-only, or loosely related spiritual content, without making
    promotional or qualitative judgments about creators.

    The research must include:
      - Comprehensive YouTube search using relevant numerology keywords
        (e.g., numerology, life path number, angel numbers, destiny number, name numerology)
      - Filtering of results strictly by highest view count
      - Exclusion of non-numerology or marginally related content
      - Verification that each selected video meaningfully discusses numerology concepts
      - Manual cross-checking to avoid duplicate uploads or re-uploads

    For each of the Top 50 videos, document:
      - Video title
      - YouTube channel name
      - Direct YouTube video URL
      - Total public view count at time of research
      - Year of publication
      - Primary numerology theme
        (e.g., Life Path, Angel Numbers, Name Numerology, Destiny Number, Predictions)
      - Video format
        (educational, explainer, prediction-based, short-form vs long-form)
      - Language of the video (if identifiable)

    The final dataset must be categorized into:
      1) Educational & Foundational Numerology Videos
      2) Angel Numbers & Repeating Number Content
      3) Predictive / Yearly / Forecast-Based Numerology
      4) Name & Business Numerology
      5) Short-Form Viral Numerology Content

    Ranking methodology must follow:
      - View count as the primary ranking criterion
      - Relevance and clarity of numerology content as a secondary qualifier
