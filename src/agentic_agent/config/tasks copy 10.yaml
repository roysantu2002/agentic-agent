    Identify **five credible and high-quality industry sources, reports, or expert analyses**
    that explain why Full-stack Architects will continue to be in strong demand even as
    Generative AI and Agentic AI systems accelerate within modern software ecosystems.

    Include:
      - Trends in enterprise digital transformation, multi-agent orchestration, cloud-native
        platform engineering, and data integration
      - Hiring reports, skills gap analyses, and architectural talent demand projections from
        reputable technology organizations
      - Architectural responsibility models for AI governance, security, privacy, and
        organizational compliance
      - Technical write-ups demonstrating how Full-stack Architects unify frontend, backend,
        cloud, data pipelines, and AI-inference layers
    Exclude:
      - Claims or narratives asserting AI can autonomously replace architectural decision-making

    For each reference, gather:
      - Name and creator (organization, research firm, or industry expert)
      - Description of content scope and strategic insights
      - Primary architectural responsibility areas highlighted (AI integration, security,
        observability, performance, developer experience, interoperability)
      - Technical or organizational approach (e.g., cloud-native patterns, AI guardrails,
        agentic workflow orchestration, platform automation)
      - Type (industry report, enterprise whitepaper, open analysis, educational content)
      - Accessibility (free, paid, gated access)
      - Official links (website, documentation, publication pages)
      - Reported market signals (talent shortage, salary growth, engineering dependency)
      - Key takeaways, strengths, and potential limitations relevant to the modern
        Full-stack Architect role

    Emphasize materials and insights that demonstrate:
      - Strong architectural governance requirements
      - Increased integration complexity due to autonomous agents
      - Reliance on human oversight, accountability, and secure architecture
      - Future-proof skill evolution across cloud, AI, and distributed systems

  expected_output: >
    Reference Architecture Demand Summary (5 detailed entries):
      - Balanced mix of industry, enterprise, and expert-backed analyses
      - Direct links to sources or official documentation
      - Comparative chart (responsibility scope, AI impact, organizational dependency,
        security posture, and talent scarcity)
      - Notes on how AI elevates architectural complexity rather than replacing it
      - Recommendation of 1–2 foundational reference sources to support the article narrative

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Convert the researcher’s findings into a **structured, persuasive article** explaining why
    Full-stack Architects remain critical in the age of Generative AI and Agentic AI. Demonstrate
    how architectural oversight, system integration, security guardrails, and cross-layer awareness
    cannot be fully delegated to autonomous AI agents.

  expected_output: >
    A structured markdown article including:
      - Overview of the 5 reference sources, categorized by type (Industry, Enterprise, Expert)
      - Brief summaries and links for each
      - Integration narrative showing how Full-stack Architects:
          * Govern AI system complexity and risk
          * Maintain compliance, security, and accountability
          * Orchestrate multi-agent workflows across distributed systems
          * Bridge cloud platforms, data pipelines, and application layers
      - Comparative table summarizing scope, architectural weight, organizational reliance,
        and projected demand
      - Demand rationale highlighting:
          * Increasing AI infrastructure complexity
          * Human-in-the-loop oversight requirements
          * Ethical, regulatory, and security imperatives
          * Enterprise interoperability challenges
      - Future competency evolution for Full-stack Architects:
          * AI integration patterns
          * Agentic orchestration models
          * Observability and guardrail frameworks
      - Key risks (AI hallucination, architectural drift, security exposure) and
        mitigation strategies led by architects
      - Final recommendation: 1 industry and 1 expert reference as the core foundation
        supporting the “architect demand persists” narrative
