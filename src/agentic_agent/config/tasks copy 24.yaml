    Conduct a deep, NCERT-aligned academic intelligence and board-pattern
    research study on **CBSE Class 12 Organic Chemistry** specifically focused
    on the following units for the **March 2026 Board Examination**:

      - Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers
      - Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids

    The objective is to identify **the highest-weightage, most frequently
    repeated, conceptually tricky, and maximum-scoring question areas**
    that determine student performance in the CBSE board exam.

    Identify and validate **five or more highly credible academic reference
    sources for each chapter**, such as NCERT textbooks, CBSE Exemplar problems,
    official marking schemes, previous 10-year board papers, reputed coaching
    institute analyses, and board-oriented digital learning platforms that
    demonstrate consistent exam relevance and scoring importance across:

      - Core foundations at the Silver level including:
        * Classification of alcohols, phenols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, acids
        * IUPAC nomenclature rules and functional group priority
        * Structural features of –OH, –O–, >C=O, and –COOH groups
        * Basic physical properties (boiling point, solubility, H-bonding)
        * Direct NCERT-based theory and definition questions

      - Mechanism and logic mastery at the Gold level including:
        * Oxidation and reduction of alcohols, aldehydes and acids
        * Williamson Ether Synthesis and ether cleavage mechanisms
        * Aldol Condensation and Cannizzaro Reaction logic
        * Tollens’, Fehling’s and Iodoform tests
        * Acidic strength comparisons using inductive and resonance effects
        * Esterification, hydrolysis and saponification reactions

      - Integrated and high-order reasoning at the Platinum level including:
        * Multi-step organic conversions involving multiple functional groups
        * Assertion–Reason and competency-based case study questions
        * Mixed-chapter interconversion problems
        * Mechanism writing under exam-time pressure
        * Board-trap questions based on reagent confusion and condition control

      - Chapter- and system-specific exam demand across:
        * Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers (Acidity, preparation, ether synthesis)
        * Aldehydes and Ketones (Carbonyl reactivity and tests)
        * Carboxylic Acids (Preparation, acidity, HVZ, esterification)
        * Comparative physical and chemical property analysis

    Include sources covering:

      - Official NCERT Chemistry Part-II textbook
      - CBSE Exemplar and Sample Paper series
      - CBSE marking schemes and examiner reports
      - Reputed institute question banks and test series
      - High-performing digital CBSE prep platforms

    Exclude:
      - Non-NCERT reference-only material
      - Competitive exam (JEE-only) content misaligned to board patterns
      - Concept-heavy content with no direct board-question application
      - Unverified or low-accuracy solution sources

    For each reference collected, gather:

      - Source type (NCERT, PYQ, marking scheme, test series, coaching material)
      - Chapter alignment (Alcohols/Phenols/Ethers or Aldehydes/Ketones/Acids)
      - Concept level mapping (Silver, Gold, or Platinum)
      - Nature of content (theory, reactions, mechanisms, PYQs, mock tests)
      - Coverage scope (nomenclature, preparation, properties, reactions, uses)
      - Primary exam intent (learning, revision, scoring, error correction)
      - Board frequency indicators (repeat years, 3–5 mark dominance, MCQ trend)
      - Common student error patterns
      - Examiner scoring expectations
      - Key takeaways applicable to building a **March 2026 High-Score Organic
        Chemistry Knowledge System**

    Emphasise sources demonstrating:

      - Repeated appearance in board exams across multiple years
      - High discrimination power (questions that separate average from toppers)
      - Strong logic-based reasoning requirements
      - Full marking-scheme compatibility
      - High conversion relevance for 90%+ board scoring
