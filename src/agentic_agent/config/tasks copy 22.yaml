    Conduct a deep, lineage-aligned academic and professional research study on
    Global Professional Numerology Systems, covering the most authoritative
    classical texts, certification curricula, calculation standards, and applied
    interpretation models used in professional numerology practice. Identify
    five highly credible sources for each lineage such as classical numerology
    texts, certified numerology schools, master practitioner manuals, astrological
    institutes, and Chinese metaphysical academies that explain:

      - Core foundations at the Silver level including:
        * Core personal identity numbers
        * Basic destiny indicators
        * Foundational charts, grids, and mappings
        * Fundamental vibration principles and number symbolism

      - Practitioner mastery at the Gold level including:
        * Prediction cycles and timing systems
        * Number combinations and compatibility analysis
        * Career, wealth, relationship, and life-event interpretation
        * Name correction, rectification, and applied numerology

      - Mastery and destiny systems at the Platinum level including:
        * Master numbers, karmic debt, and hidden influence structures
        * Long-term destiny and life-phase forecasting
        * Business, branding, and corporate numerology
        * Global cycles and mass-event numerology
        * Multi-system fusion and advanced chart synthesis

      - Lineage-specific coverage across:
        * Pythagorean Numerology (Life Path systems, cycles, pinnacles)
        * Chaldean Numerology (Name vibration and sound-frequency mechanics)
        * Vedic Numerology (Mulank, planetary rulership, yogas)
        * Chinese Numerology (Lo Shu Grid, Five Elements, BaZi numeric destiny)

    Include sources covering:

      - Classical lineage-authentic texts
      - Modern professional certification curricula
      - Practitioner training manuals
      - Applied business and predictive numerology guides
      - Institutional and academy-level teaching material

    Exclude:
      - Superstitious or non-lineage-based numerology content
      - Social media or non-academic tutorials
      - Soft spiritual content without calculation methodology
      - Systems not traceable to the four defined lineages

    For each reference collected, gather:

      - Source type (classical text, academy syllabus, practitioner manual, certification guide)
      - Lineage alignment (Pythagorean, Chaldean, Vedic, Chinese)
      - Level coverage (Silver, Gold, Platinum)
      - Nature of content (theoretical, practical, predictive, business-oriented)
      - Coverage scope (personal, relationship, career, health, spiritual, corporate)
      - Difficulty level (entry, practitioner, master)
      - Strengths and limitations (clarity, depth, applicability, lineage purity)
      - Relevance to professional practice and certification training
      - Reliability rating (classical authority, academic adoption, certification usage)
      - Key takeaways applicable to creating a complete Silver-Gold-Platinum
        numerology question-answer repository

    Emphasize sources demonstrating:

      - Stepwise calculation procedures with correct reduction methods
      - Clear interpretation rules and prediction logic
      - Repeated practitioner usage and case-study validation
      - Structured progression from core identity to destiny-level mastery
      - Cross-lineage comparison with philosophical integrity
