    Investigate real-world applications of Agentic AI across industries and
    domains. Focus on credible, high-impact deployments that illustrate the
    paradigm shift from generative outputs to autonomous action. Areas to
    explore:
      - Business and productivity: Microsoft Copilot Studio, enterprise copilots,
        workflow/document automation, and decision support.
      - Customer experience & service: Claude, GPT-based agents, personalization
        at scale, balancing efficiency with empathy.
      - Operations & automation: UiPath, Adept AI, logistics, supply chain, and
        financial operations.
      - Research & knowledge work: LangChain, LlamaIndex, agents as research
        copilots, education, corporate learning, and upskilling.
      - Emerging domains: healthcare (clinical assistants, drug discovery),
        creative industries (media, design, art), science, climate, and policy.

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Expand on the research by developing a detailed markdown section that
    contextualizes each application area. Each chapter should clearly describe:
      - The tools/platforms used
      - How they are applied in practice
      - Benefits and measurable outcomes
      - Challenges and trade-offs
      - Industry examples or adoption stories
    The focus should be on showing how Agentic AI transitions from theory to
    practice, with emphasis on cross-domain patterns and emerging opportunities.
  expected_output: >
    A polished markdown section (without code fences) containing:
      - Part III: Real-World Applications
      - Five chapters (8–12), each expanded into narrative sections
      - Real-world examples with tools, use cases, pros/cons, and adoption notes
      - Closing insights on cross-sector themes and future opportunities
