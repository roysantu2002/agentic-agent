research_task:
  description: >
    Perform a structured, end-to-end YouTube research study focused exclusively on numerology
    content that has achieved significant audience reach.
    
    The research must include:
      - Systematic YouTube searches using verified numerology-related keywords
        (e.g., numerology, life path number, destiny number, angel numbers,
         name numerology, business numerology)
      - Ranking results strictly by publicly visible view count
      - Manual verification that each video meaningfully addresses numerology concepts
      - Exclusion of astrology-only, tarot-only, motivational-only, or loosely related content
    
    For each of the Top 50 numerology videos, document:
      - Video title
      - YouTube channel name
      - Direct video URL
      - Total view count (as displayed publicly)
      - Year of publication
      - Core numerology theme
        (e.g., Life Path, Angel Numbers, Name Numerology, Destiny Numbers, Forecasting)
      - Content format
        (educational explainer, predictive analysis, storytelling, short-form vs long-form)
      - Primary language of the video (if identifiable)
    
    Categorize the finalized list into the following groups:
      1) Foundational & Educational Numerology Content
      2) Angel Numbers & Repeating Number Interpretations
      3) Predictive, Yearly, or Forecast-Based Numerology
      4) Name, Business, and Identity-Based Numerology
      5) Short-Form and Viral Numerology Content
    
    Rank videos using:
      - View count as the primary ranking metric
      - Depth and relevance of numerology discussion as a secondary qualifier

  deliverables:
    - Ranked list of the Top 50 most-viewed numerology videos with clickable links
    - Summary table capturing key metrics (views, year, theme, format, language)
    - Topic frequency analysis highlighting the most-consumed numerology themes
    - Insights into content length, structure, and presentation styles driving high viewership
    - Observations on audience behavior, recurring formats, and identifiable content gaps

  constraints:
    - Use only publicly available YouTube data
    - Do not estimate, project, or manipulate view counts
    - Avoid promotional bias toward any individual creator or channel
    - Clearly distinguish numerology content from astrology, tarot, or generalized spirituality
    - Maintain neutral, analytical, and non-promotional language throughout
