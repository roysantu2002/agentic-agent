    Conduct a complete, step-by-step application process research study for Singapore’s
    highly selective public universities: National University of Singapore (NUS),
    Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore Management University (SMU),
    Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), and Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT).
    The objective is to document every stage of applying after Class 12 from India,
    starting from locating the official university website and admissions URL,
    navigating the application portal, preparing documents, and completing final submission.
    The research must be procedural, accurate, and suitable for first-time international applicants.
    For each university (NUS, NTU, SMU, SUTD, SIT):
      - Identify the official university website and undergraduate admissions URL
      - Map eligibility criteria for Indian Class 12 qualifications
      - Document accepted boards, subject requirements, and academic thresholds
      - Identify standardized test requirements, waivers, or alternatives
      - Record application opening dates, deadlines, and result timelines
      - Detail account creation and portal navigation steps
      - List all required documents with format, size, and upload rules
      - Describe essays, personal statements, interviews, or assessments (if any)
      - Document referee or school verification requirements
      - Detail application fee payment methods and confirmation checks
      - Outline declaration, review, and final submission steps
      - Document post-submission processes: interviews, offers, acceptance, enrolment
      - Identify common errors, rejection risks, and compliance warnings
      - Compare similarities and differences across all five universities
