    Identify **five credible, enterprise-relevant sources, reference guides, or expert analyses**
    explaining how Microsoft Copilot, Microsoft Graph, or LLM orchestration platforms can be
    leveraged to analyze automated inbound emails and trigger operational workflows such as
    resolution guidance, triage recommendations, or incident ticket creation.

    Include:
      - Official Microsoft documentation on Copilot extensibility, plugin models, and skills
      - Microsoft Graph APIs for email access, event subscriptions, and processing pipelines
      - Enterprise reference architectures for ITSM automation and ticket lifecycle integration
      - Patterns for classification, metadata enrichment, entity extraction, and remediation routing
      - Agentic workflow orchestration frameworks integrating verification, escalation, and guardrails
    Exclude:
      - Hobby projects, unverifiable claims, or non-enterprise tooling patterns

    For each reference collected, gather:
      - Name/creator (Microsoft, enterprise vendor, industry expert)
      - Scope of guidance and strategic insights
      - Primary operational responsibility areas (security, classification accuracy, compliance,
        data privacy, observability, incident lifecycle)
      - Technical or architectural approach (Graph event hooks, email pipelines, agentic
        orchestration, plugin execution flows, guardrails)
      - Type (official documentation, enterprise whitepaper, implementation blog, reference repo)
      - Accessibility (free, gated, subscription)
      - Official publication or repository links
      - Reported applicability to ITSM, ticketing automation, MTTR reduction
      - Key takeaways, strengths, and limitations relevant to enterprise adoption

    Emphasize materials demonstrating:
      - Secure design principles for email-driven automation
      - Proper handling of compliance and data privacy boundaries
      - Human oversight and verification layers
      - Increased integration complexity when autonomous agents interact with operational systems

  expected_output: >
    Email Automation Architecture Reference Summary (5 detailed entries):
      - Balanced mix of official Microsoft guidance, enterprise analyses, and expert content
      - Direct links to documentation, whitepapers, or repositories
      - Comparative chart (processing scope, integration complexity, guardrail maturity,
        security posture, enterprise readiness)
      - Notes explaining where agentic AI enhances operational resilience rather than replacing
        human accountability
      - Recommendation of 1–2 core reference sources to anchor architectural decisions

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Convert the researcher’s findings into a **structured, actionable blueprint** explaining how
    Microsoft Copilot, Graph APIs, and agentic orchestration layers can automate the processing of
    automated inbound emails to recommend remediation steps, enrich context, and generate incident
    tickets within ITSM platforms.

  expected_output: >
    A structured markdown delivery including:
      - Categorized overview of the five reference sources (Official, Enterprise, Expert, Implementation)
      - Brief summaries and source links
      - An integration narrative describing how email inputs can:
          * Trigger classification and entity extraction
          * Surface remediation recommendations
          * Auto-generate or update incident tickets
          * Support escalations and verification
      - Comparative table detailing integration scope, operational complexity, guardrails,
        enterprise readiness, and cost considerations
      - Rationale for adoption highlighting:
          * MTTR reduction
          * Manual workload reduction
          * Auditability, traceability, and security
          * Reduction of noisy or duplicate notifications
      - Future-proofing considerations:
          * Agentic orchestration models and escalation loops
          * Observability and audit telemetry
          * Data privacy binding and access control
      - Risks (misclassification, notification storms, privilege misuse) and mitigation
        strategies via policy and architecture guardrails
      - Final recommendation: 1 official Microsoft reference and 1 implementation-focused
        expert resource to anchor design justification
