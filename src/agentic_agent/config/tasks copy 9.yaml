    Identify **five credible and high-quality SAT Math preparation resources**
    (official, open-source, or academically recognized) that help students effectively
    prepare for the SAT Math section within a one-month timeline.

    Include:
      - Official SAT Math resources from the College Board and trusted educational platforms
        such as Khan Academy.
      - Well-structured open or educational study programs, guides, and video series focused
        on quantitative reasoning, algebra, geometry, and data analysis.
      - Academic or instructor-developed projects that demonstrate clear methodology,
        progressive concept reinforcement, and measurable improvement in problem-solving speed
        and accuracy.
    Exclude:
      - Outdated, incomplete, or unverified materials not aligned with the current SAT Math format.

    For each resource, gather:
      - Name and creator (organization, educator, or platform)
      - Description of content and learning goals
      - Target section(s) (Heart of Algebra, Problem Solving & Data Analysis, Passport to
        Advanced Math, Geometry, or General Strategy)
      - Technical or instructional approach (e.g., adaptive testing, step-by-step video
        explanations, AI-driven practice analytics, spaced repetition)
      - Type (official, open-source, educational, or coaching)
      - Accessibility (free, paid, or mixed)
      - Official links (website, videos, or documentation)
      - Reported or observed results (average score improvement, accuracy, or engagement)
      - Key takeaways, strengths, and potential limitations relevant to our one-month plan

    Emphasize materials and systems that demonstrate:
      - Strong pedagogical structure and concept clarity
      - Efficient practice-to-improvement feedback cycles
      - Progressive difficulty suited for one-month intensive SAT Math preparation

    Reference Math Study Resources Summary (5 detailed entries):
      - Balanced mix of official, open, and educational math materials
      - Direct links to sources or documentation
      - Comparative chart (topic coverage, difficulty, adaptiveness, and relevance)
      - Notes on how to adapt each for a CBSE 10+2 student’s one-month math preparation plan
      - Recommendation of 1–2 main study references (one comprehensive, one skill-focused)
        to serve as the foundation for our math preparation plan

    Convert the researcher’s findings into a **concise and actionable SAT Math preparation roadmap**
    that guides daily and weekly study activities. Clearly separate official and educational resources,
    and highlight how each can support conceptual mastery, speed, and accuracy within a one-month timeline.

  expected_output: >
    A structured markdown report including:
      - Overview of the 5 reference study resources, categorized as "Official" or "Educational"
      - Brief summaries and links for each
      - Integration guide showing how to combine best practices into a unified math study plan:
          * Algebra → Linear equations, inequalities, and functions
          * Problem Solving & Data Analysis → Ratios, percentages, and data interpretation
          * Advanced Math → Quadratic equations, exponents, and polynomial manipulation
          * Geometry → Coordinate and plane geometry essentials
      - Comparative table summarizing scope, adaptiveness, and learning outcomes
      - 4-week math preparation roadmap with daily and weekly focus areas:
          * Week 1 → Concept review and diagnostic baseline
          * Week 2 → Topic-specific drills and formula retention
          * Week 3 → Timed section practice and error analysis
          * Week 4 → Full mock tests and strategy refinement
      - Key risks (over-practice fatigue, formula overload, pacing issues) and mitigation strategies
      - Final recommendation: 1 official and 1 educational resource as the core of the math study plan
