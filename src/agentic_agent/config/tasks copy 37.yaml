    Conduct a structured, data-driven research study to identify, analyze, and
    document proven models, practices, and implementation patterns for establishing
    an enterprise-grade AI & Agentic AI Center of Excellence (AI COE). The objective
    is to build a clear, verifiable knowledge base to guide the setup of a Unified AI
    Services capability that can be leveraged across technology towers, enabling
    AI-driven service and operations automation while improving MTTR, strengthening
    SLO/SLI discipline, and accelerating speed-to-market for AI-enabled use cases.

    The research must clearly distinguish production-grade, operational AI COE
    implementations from experimental-only, proof-of-concept, academic, or
    vendor-promotional initiatives, without making qualitative or promotional
    endorsements of specific tools, platforms, or organizations.

    The research must include:
      - Systematic searches across publicly accessible and verifiable sources
        (e.g., enterprise architecture publications, industry case studies,
         cloud and platform reference architectures, AI governance frameworks,
         SRE and AIOps documentation)
      - Use of verified enterprise AI and Agentic AI keywords
        (e.g., AI Center of Excellence, Agentic AI architecture, enterprise AI platform,
         unified AI services, AIOps, multi-agent systems, MTTR reduction through AI)
      - Exclusion of AI initiatives that are experimental-only, research-focused,
        or lack demonstrable operational adoption
      - Manual verification that identified AI COE practices are aligned with
        enterprise governance, security, and compliance requirements
      - Cross-checking to avoid duplicated case studies, rebranded initiatives,
        or outdated AI operating models

    For each verified AI COE model, framework, or enterprise practice, document:
      - Organization or industry context
      - AI COE scope and mandate
      - Unified AI services owned and delivered
      - AI and Agentic AI capabilities implemented
      - Type of operating model
        (centralized, federated, hybrid)
      - Integration points with service and operations
        (ITSM, SRE, DevOps, SecOps, NOC/SOC)
      - Governance, risk, and control mechanisms
        (model governance, agent oversight, auditability, compliance)
      - Talent roles and skill requirements
      - Key operational metrics tracked
        (MTTR, SLO, SLI, automation coverage, release velocity)
      - Implementation timelines and maturity stages

    The finalized dataset must be categorized into:
      1) Centralized AI & Agentic AI COE Models
      2) Federated and Hybrid AI COE Operating Structures
      3) Unified AI Service Platforms and Reusable AI Capabilities
      4) Agentic AI Adoption Patterns
         (assistive, semi-autonomous, governed autonomous)
      5) AI Governance, Risk, and Compliance Frameworks

    Prioritization methodology must follow:
      - Demonstrated impact on MTTR reduction and operational efficiency
      - Effectiveness in enforcing SLO and SLI discipline
      - Ability to deliver reusable AI services across technology towers
      - Speed-to-market for AI-enabled service and operations use cases
      - Scalability, cost efficiency, and governance maturity

  description: >
    Produce a clear, structured analytical report based on the research findings that
    helps enterprise leaders, architects, service owners, and operations teams
    understand how to design, govern, and scale an AI & Agentic AI Center of
    Excellence that delivers unified AI services and measurable improvements in
    MTTR, SLO/SLI compliance, and speed-to-market.

    The report must remain neutral, non-promotional, and insight-driven, avoiding
    endorsements while emphasizing verifiable patterns, operating models, governance
    frameworks, and structural characteristics of successful enterprise AI COEs.

    The report should include:
      - Executive summary of key findings
      - Overview of AI & Agentic AI COE operating models
      - Comparative analysis of centralized, federated, and hybrid approaches
      - Breakdown of Unified AI Service offerings and consumption models
      - Agentic AI maturity trends and governance considerations
      - Common operational metrics and performance measurement frameworks
      - Identified opportunities for improved AI adoption, reuse, and execution
        discipline across service and operations domains
