    Conduct a structured, evidence-based biographical and consciousness research
    study to identify, analyze, and document the complete life journey of Indian
    film actor Vinod Khanna — from cinematic superstardom to radical spiritual
    renunciation and eventual reintegration into public life.

    The objective is to build a clear, verifiable knowledge base that directly
    supports the creation of curriculum-ready educational material examining
    spiritual seeking, ego dissolution, identity collapse, surrender, consequence,
    and conscious reintegration, suitable for long-form, video-based learning.

    The research must clearly distinguish lived spiritual transformation from
    inspirational storytelling, belief-based spirituality, mythologized guru
    narratives, or sensationalized celebrity discourse — without promoting or
    condemning any spiritual ideology, teacher, or movement.

    The research must include:
      - Systematic analysis of Vinod Khanna’s life phases as a consciousness
        development case study
        (e.g., identity formation through fame, existential dissatisfaction,
         voluntary renunciation, ego stripping through loss, psychological
         disorientation, reintegration and maturity)
      - Review of primary and secondary biographical sources including interviews,
        public statements, historical records, and cultural commentary
      - Use of verified psychological and consciousness-learning constructs
        (e.g., ego identity, surrender dynamics, meaning crisis, observer awareness,
         disillusionment, embodiment, integration)
      - Clear differentiation between spiritual discipline and spiritual bypass
      - Exclusion of devotional framing, political bias, metaphysical claims,
        gossip narratives, or guru-centric glorification
      - Manual verification that each life phase can be translated into structured
        lessons, reflective inquiry, discussion prompts, and learner-safe
        consciousness education modules
      - Cross-checking to avoid romanticized renunciation, symbolic-only spirituality,
        or ungrounded enlightenment narratives

    For each verified life phase and transformation domain, document:
      - Core consciousness shift or identity change involved
      - Psychological and emotional challenges encountered
      - Internal learning themes and awareness development
      - Readiness level of the subject at that stage
        (identity-bound, questioning, surrendering, disoriented, reintegrating)
      - Sequential progression and pacing of transformation
      - Experiential learning parallels
        (reflection, inquiry, observation, self-awareness exercises)
      - Real-world consequences and responsibility implications
      - Ethical boundaries and cautionary insights for spiritual seekers

    The finalized dataset must be categorized into:
      1) Formation of Identity Through Success and Fame
      2) Existential Crisis and Search for Meaning
      3) Radical Renunciation and Ego Dissolution
      4) Cost, Disillusionment, and Psychological Consequences
      5) Reintegration, Responsibility, and Mature Conscious Living

    Prioritization methodology must follow:
      - Historical accuracy and verifiability
      - Depth and realism of inner transformation
      - Psychological and emotional safety in interpretation
      - Non-idealized, non-romanticized spirituality
      - Applicability to modern consciousness education
        (reflection → awareness → integration)

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Produce a clear, curriculum-focused analytical report that enables educators,
    documentary creators, and consciousness studies facilitators to design,
    structure, and deliver long-form educational content based on Vinod Khanna’s
    complete life journey.

    The report must emphasize realism, consequence, and integration — ensuring
    learners understand spirituality not as escape from life, but as a demanding
    process involving loss, uncertainty, and responsibility.

    The report must remain neutral, non-devotional, and non-promotional,
    prioritizing psychological clarity, self-agency, ethical interpretation,
    and grounded understanding of spiritual seeking within real-world contexts.

    The report should include:
      - Executive summary of Vinod Khanna’s life as a consciousness case study
      - Recommended end-to-end learning blueprint
        (identity → crisis → surrender → consequence → reintegration)
      - Detailed module and lesson templates
      - Guidance on balancing biography, reflection, and awareness inquiry
      - Integration models applicable to career, relationships, purpose,
        and daily responsibility
      - Ethical teaching boundaries and learner readiness indicators
      - Cautionary notes on romanticizing renunciation or spiritual authority
      - Opportunities for advanced study, facilitation tracks,
        and long-form educational series


  expected_output: >
    A structured markdown curriculum and content strategy report containing:
      - Complete Vinod Khanna life-journey education blueprint
      - Modular lesson outlines with learning objectives and reflection prompts
      - Sequencing and pacing models for long-form video education
      - Integration frameworks for mature, embodied understanding
      - Risk-aware guidance for teaching spiritual biographies
      - Strategic insights for scalable consciousness education
        using real-life transformation narratives
