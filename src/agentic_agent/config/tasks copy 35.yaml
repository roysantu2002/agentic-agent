  description: >
    Conduct a structured, data-driven research study to identify, verify, and document
    accredited Bachelor’s degree technology programs in Germany that are accessible to
    Indian students after completion of 10+2 (Class XII). The objective is to build a
    clear, verifiable dataset of German undergraduate technology education pathways
    suitable for curriculum planning, student advisory frameworks, and long-term
    international education ecosystem analysis, with specific focus on the 2026
    admission cycle.

    The research must clearly distinguish officially recognized degree programs from
    non-degree, vocational-only, pathway-only, or promotional education offerings,
    without making qualitative or promotional endorsements of individual universities
    or institutions.

    The research must include:
      - Systematic searches across publicly accessible sources
        (e.g., official university websites, DAAD resources, uni-assist listings,
         German higher education portals)
      - Use of verified keywords
        (e.g., Bachelor of Engineering Germany, Bachelor of Technology Germany,
         Computer Science undergraduate Germany, Engineering after 12th Germany,
         Studienkolleg Germany)
      - Exclusion of diploma-only, short-term certification, or unaccredited programs
      - Manual verification that each program is officially recognized under German
        higher education regulations
      - Cross-checking to avoid duplicate listings, rebranded programs, or outdated
        academic offerings

    For each verified Bachelor’s degree technology program or university, document:
      - University name
      - Degree and program title
      - Technology discipline
        (e.g., Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering,
         Information Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Mechatronics, Data Science)
      - Type of institution
        (public university, technical university, university of applied sciences)
      - Medium of instruction
        (German, English, bilingual)
      - Eligibility criteria for Indian students after 10+2
        (including subject requirements and minimum academic thresholds)
      - Admission pathway
        (direct admission or Studienkolleg requirement)
      - Application route
        (uni-assist, direct university application, centralized portal)
      - Indicative tuition fees
        (public vs private institutions)
      - Estimated living expenses
      - Application timelines relevant to the 2026 intake

    The finalized dataset must be categorized into:
      1) Computer Science, IT, and Data-Focused Bachelor’s Programs
      2) Core Engineering Disciplines
         (Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Chemical)
      3) Emerging and Applied Technology Programs
         (AI, Robotics, Mechatronics, Embedded Systems)
      4) English-Taught Undergraduate Technology Pathways
      5) Public vs Private University Degree Structures

    Prioritization methodology must follow:
      - Frequency of Indian student enrollment
      - Academic and technological rigor of the program
      - Transparency of admission requirements and pathways
      - Accessibility for Indian 10+2 qualification holders
      - Cost-efficiency and public funding structure

    German Undergraduate Technology Education Research Summary:
      - Curated list of accredited German universities offering Bachelor’s technology
        degrees suitable for Indian students after 10+2
      - Summary tables including institution type, discipline, language, fees,
        and admission route
      - Category-wise distribution of programs by technology discipline
      - Analysis of direct admission vs Studienkolleg-based pathways
      - Observations on academic structure, cost models, and institutional patterns
      - Identification of common challenges and preparation gaps faced by Indian applicants

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Produce a clear, structured analytical report based on the research findings that helps
    Indian students, academic advisors, educators, and international education planners
    understand the German undergraduate technology education landscape, including
    eligibility realities, admission pathways, cost structures, and institutional trends.

    The report must remain neutral, non-promotional, and insight-driven, avoiding
    endorsements while emphasizing verifiable patterns, regulatory frameworks,
    and structural characteristics of German higher education.

    The report should include:
      - Executive summary of key findings
      - Overview of German Bachelor’s degree structures in technology and engineering
      - Comparative analysis of public vs private universities
      - Breakdown of direct admission and Studienkolleg pathways
      - Language-of-instruction trends across undergraduate technology programs
      - Common eligibility requirements and recurring admission constraints
      - Identified opportunities for improved academic preparation and guidance


  expected_output: >
    A structured markdown research report containing:
      - Categorized university and program listings with official links
      - Comparative tables of institution type, discipline, language, and fees
      - Admission pathway and eligibility analysis
      - Trend observations across German undergraduate technology education
      - Strategic insights for ethical, accurate student guidance and planning
