      - Source type (NCERT text, CBSE document, reference book, coding documentation)
      - Syllabus alignment (exact, partial, supplementary)
      - Nature of content (conceptual, practical, exam-oriented)
      - Coverage scope (theory, SQL, Python interface, case-based)
      - Difficulty level (easy, moderate, board-level)
      - Strengths and limitations (clarity, exam relevance, depth)
      - Relevance to Pre-Board and Board examination preparation
      - Reliability rating (CBSE authority, academic adoption, classroom usage)
      - Key takeaways applicable to creating a **complete Unit 3 question–answer repository**

    Emphasize sources demonstrating:

      - Stepwise command execution with correct syntax
      - Board-style output-based questions
      - Repeated examination patterns and PYQ relevance
      - Clear integration of Python with SQL for practical exams
      - A structured mastery progression (Concepts → Commands → Applications → Case Studies)

  expected_output: >
    CBSE Unit 3 Research Summary (5+ validated academic and board-authoritative sources):

      - A balanced mix of NCERT authority, CBSE official documents,
        exam-focused reference books, and Python–SQL educational resources
      - Bibliographic references for:
          * Textbooks, CBSE documents, and coding references
      - Comparison matrix across:
          * Unit 3 topics (Database Concepts, RDBMS, SQL, Python–SQL Interface)
          * Learning focus (theory, practical, output-based, case-based)
          * Assessment type (MCQs, short answer, long answer, practical)
      - Notes supporting the creation of a structured **100% scoring Unit 3 question bank** explaining:
          * “How should a student progress from basic concepts to board-level mastery?”
          * “Which SQL and Python skills must be demonstrated at each level?”
          * “What differentiates an average answer from a full-mark board answer?”
      - Recommendation of 1–2 primary academic frameworks to serve as the
        foundational model for Unit 3 classroom teaching, exam preparation,
        and digital learning platforms.
