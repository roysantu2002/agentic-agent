  description: >
    Identify **five existing solutions** (products, open-source projects, or documented deployments)
    that have solved — or closely addressed — the problem of filtering irrelevant, duplicate,
    or misrouted IT/VDI support tickets (i.e., intelligent ticket triage / automated routing).
    Specifically:
      - Find exactly 5 solutions that are the best references for implementing VDI ticket filtering.
      - For each solution, gather:
        - Name and provider / repo
        - Short description of what it does and the problem it solves
        - Real-world usage or deployment examples (customers, case studies, or documented pilots)
        - Technical stack / components (e.g., whether it uses LLMs/embeddings, rule engines,
          LangGraph-like orchestration, Gemini-style multimodal models, React frontends, FastAPI backends, etc.)
        - Whether it is commercial, open-source, or hybrid, plus links to product pages or code repos
        - Integration notes: how it connects to ITSM/VDI systems (ServiceNow, Jira, Citrix/VMware consoles, email, etc.)
        - Measured outcomes or KPIs where available (reduction in misrouted tickets, time-to-resolution, queue improvements)
        - Key strengths, limitations, and lessons learned that are directly applicable to our build
      - Prioritize solutions that provide concrete artifacts we can reference (architectural diagrams, repo code, whitepapers,
        blog posts, or case studies).
      - When a solution does not natively use tools we plan to adopt, explain how Gemini, LangGraph, React, and FastAPI
        could be incorporated as practical substitutions or enhancements.
  expected_output: >
    Reference Solutions Summary (5 items):
      - A numbered list of 5 complete solution profiles containing the fields above
      - Direct links to product pages, repos, case studies, or architecture docs for each solution
      - Practical notes on how to adapt or combine existing approaches with Gemini, LangGraph, React, and FastAPI
      - Quick comparison table highlighting trade-offs (open-source vs commercial, ease of integration, maturity)
      - Recommended 1–2 reference solutions to use as primary blueprints for our VDI ticket-filtering implementation

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Convert the researcher’s 5-solution findings into a concise reference brief for the engineering team
    and stakeholders. The brief should make it immediately actionable which solutions to study first,
    what to clone/read, and how to prototype quickly using our chosen stack.
  expected_output: >
    A polished markdown brief containing:
      - Summary of the 5 reference solutions with direct links and one-paragraph takeaways
      - Concrete next steps for prototyping (which repo to fork, which architecture to emulate, which integrations to prioritize)
      - Recommended mapping of components to our stack (Gemini for model layer, LangGraph for orchestration,
        FastAPI for backend services, React for the dashboard) with brief rationale
      - Risks, dependencies, and integration checklist for a 4–8 week prototype
      - Final recommendation: 1 primary and 1 secondary reference to start implementation from
