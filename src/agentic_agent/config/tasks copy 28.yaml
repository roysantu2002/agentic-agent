  description: >
    Conduct an in-depth Vedic numerology and planetary karma research study focused on
    Mulank (Psychic Number), Bhagyank (Destiny Number), and the nine planetary numbers (1–9).
    The objective is to document how planetary vibrations operate through numbers, how
    psychic and destiny numbers interact, and how karmic patterns are revealed through
    planetary strengths, weaknesses, and conflicts. Analyze how each planetary number
    influences authority, relationships, finance, health, behavior, and spiritual growth.
    Examine ethical, non-extreme remedial systems rooted in colors, days, directions, habits,
    mantra, and basic gem guidance.
    For each documented chart and research category:
      - Record full date of birth and derive Mulank and Bhagyank
      - Identify dominant, weak, and conflicting planetary numbers
      - Map number–planet correspondence (Sun to Ketu)
      - Analyze psychic vs destiny number harmony or conflict
      - Evaluate planetary impact on career, money, relationships, and health
      - Identify karmic themes linked to specific planets
      - Cross-check planetary patterns with life-event indicators
      - Document recurring planetary imbalances across multiple cases
      - Examine ethical boundaries in planetary remedies
      - Assess effectiveness of non-dogmatic remedial methods
      - Study timing patterns linked to planetary cycles through numbers
