  goal: >
    Conduct a comprehensive, structured exploration of the most demanded and
    emerging learning themes in Spiritual Growth & Consciousness Development
    for 2026 and beyond, with specific focus on long-form, video-based education.

    The research aims to identify scalable, high-intent consciousness-learning
    domains aligned with evolving human needs—self-awareness, meaning, inner
    stability, presence, integration, and conscious living—while filtering out
    trend-only, low-retention, or non-instructional spiritual content.
  backstory: >
    You are a specialist research analyst with deep expertise in consciousness
    education, contemplative practices, spiritual psychology, and long-form
    learning design. Your work emphasizes learner readiness, ethical depth,
    long-term relevance, and curriculum viability for structured spiritual
    education rather than inspirational, belief-driven, or guru-centric content.


research_task:
  description: >
    Perform an end-to-end research study to identify the top high-demand and
    future-resilient course themes specifically within Spiritual Growth &
    Consciousness Development that learners are actively seeking through
    video-based learning platforms.

    The research must include:
      - Systematic analysis of global learner intent related to spiritual
        awareness, presence, self-inquiry, and consciousness development
      - Use of verified consciousness-learning keywords and topic clusters
        (e.g., awareness vs identity, observer consciousness, spiritual
         integration, mindfulness beyond basics, ego structures, witness state,
         non-dual foundations, embodied spirituality)
      - Clear differentiation between inspirational spiritual content and
        structured, teachable, curriculum-ready consciousness education
      - Validation that identified topics support progressive learning,
        experiential practice, and long-term integration
      - Exclusion of fear-based, cult-driven, predictive, or belief-enforced
        spiritual narratives lacking grounded learning frameworks

    For each identified consciousness-development course theme, document:
      - Core learner aspiration or developmental challenge
      - Internal awareness or consciousness capacity being cultivated
      - Primary learner segment
        (e.g., beginners, seekers, intermediate practitioners, advanced integrators)
      - Suitability for video-based explanation and guided practice
      - Curriculum depth potential
        (introductory, intermediate, advanced, integration-focused)
      - Long-term relevance beyond spiritual trend cycles
      - Compatibility with multi-module programs, certifications, or mastery paths

    Identify and validate at least 15 high-demand course themes based on:
      - Learner intent and readiness for inner work
      - Emotional and existential relevance
      - Willingness to invest time and money in structured spiritual education
      - Depth of transformation and integration potential
      - Cross-cultural applicability and belief neutrality
      - Suitability for ethical, responsible consciousness teaching


  deliverables:
    - Curated list of Top 15 high-demand course themes in Spiritual Growth &
      Consciousness Development for 2026 and beyond
    - Learner intent map linking inner needs to consciousness-learning themes
    - Topic-to-curriculum depth assessment
      (intro course, flagship program, mastery pathway)
    - Recommended course positioning
      (self-paced, guided practice, integration-focused, mastery-level)
    - Content differentiation guidance to avoid commoditized spirituality
    - Long-term consciousness education ecosystem opportunities
      (bundles, pathways, certifications, mentorship)


  constraints:
    - Focus exclusively on grounded, ethical, and non-dogmatic spiritual education
    - Avoid fear-based awakening narratives or dependency-oriented teaching
    - Do not assume belief; emphasize experience, inquiry, and self-agency
    - Maintain psychological safety and learner responsibility
    - Use neutral, research-driven, learner-first language
    - Prioritize long-term depth over short-term virality
