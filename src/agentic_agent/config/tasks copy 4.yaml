    Conduct a reflective synthesis on the state of Agentic AI in {current_year}. 
    Investigate how Agentic AI is already in use, and where its real power comes 
    from the alignment of design, domain expertise, tooling, and organizational culture. 
    Identify practical principles for building impactful systems and the broader 
    implications for human–AI collaboration.

reflection_reporting_task:
  description: >
    Expand the reflection findings into a polished closing narrative for the book. 
    Organize the content into two parts:
      - Reflection & Summary: key takeaways and practical guidance for readers
      - Closing Reflection: positioning Agentic AI as an extension of human agency, 
        not a replacement, while emphasizing ethics, governance, and responsibility.
    Highlight that the future is about "humans with agents," not "humans versus agents," 
    and that today’s choices will shape whether the outcome is empowerment or regret.
