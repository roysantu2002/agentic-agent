    Conduct a comprehensive, structured exploration of Bachelor’s degree technology
    programs in Germany available to Indian students after 10+2. The research aims
    to identify accredited universities, technology-focused degree offerings,
    admission pathways, eligibility frameworks, cost structures, and enrollment
    trends relevant to the 2026 admission cycle.
  backstory: >
    You are a specialist research analyst with expertise in international higher
    education systems, German public university frameworks, STEM-focused degree
    pathways, and Indian student mobility trends. Your work emphasizes regulatory
    accuracy, transparent admissions processes, public funding structures, and
    realistic academic preparedness, while filtering out misleading, promotional,
    or consultancy-driven narratives.


research_task:
  description: >
    Perform an end-to-end research study focused on Bachelor’s degree technology
    education in Germany for Indian students after completion of 10+2 (Class XII),
    with specific relevance to the 2026 academic intake.

    The research must include:
      - Systematic exploration of German public and private universities offering
        Bachelor’s programs in technology-related disciplines
      - Use of verified keywords
        (e.g., Bachelor of Engineering Germany, Bachelor of Technology Germany,
         Computer Science Germany undergraduate, Engineering after 12th Germany,
         Studienkolleg Germany, TU universities Germany)
      - Clear differentiation between direct admission pathways and Studienkolleg
        (foundation year) routes
      - Manual verification that each program is officially recognized and
        accredited under German higher education regulations
      - Exclusion of diploma-only, vocational-only, or non-degree pathways

    For each identified Bachelor’s degree program or university, document:
      - University name
      - Program / degree title
      - Field of technology
        (e.g., Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering,
         Information Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Mechatronics, Data Science)
      - Type of institution
        (public university, technical university, university of applied sciences)
      - Medium of instruction
        (German / English / bilingual)
      - Eligibility requirements for Indian students after 10+2
        (including subject prerequisites and grade expectations)
      - Admission pathway
        (direct admission or Studienkolleg requirement)
      - Application platform
        (e.g., uni-assist, direct university portal)
      - Indicative annual tuition fees
        (public vs private institutions)
      - Estimated living expenses
      - Application timelines relevant to the 2026 intake

    Rank and analyze universities based on:
      - Frequency of Indian student enrollment
      - Strength of technology and engineering reputation
      - Availability of English-taught undergraduate programs
      - Industry linkage and applied learning focus
      - Geographic concentration of Indian student communities


  deliverables:
    - Curated list of accredited German universities offering Bachelor’s technology
      degrees suitable for Indian students after 10+2
    - Top 10 German universities most frequently chosen by Indian students for
      undergraduate technology education
    - Summary table capturing university type, program focus, language, fees,
      and admission route
    - Step-by-step overview of the German admission process for Indian students,
      including Studienkolleg where applicable
    - Comparative insights into public vs private university cost structures,
      academic rigor, and employability orientation
    - Identification of common challenges, misconceptions, and preparation gaps
      faced by Indian applicants


  constraints:
    - Use only publicly accessible and verifiable information
    - Do not infer guaranteed admissions, outcomes, or employment prospects
    - Avoid promotional bias toward any university, agent, or consultancy
    - Clearly distinguish between direct admission and foundation-year pathways
    - Maintain neutral, analytical, and policy-aligned language throughout

    International Education Systems & Curriculum Pathway Analyst
  goal: >
    Synthesize research findings into a clear, structured analytical report that
    helps students, educators, counselors, and academic planners understand the
    German undergraduate technology education landscape for Indian students,
    including eligibility realities, cost structures, and long-term academic
    alignment.
  backstory: >
    You specialize in translating complex international education systems into
    transparent, student-centric insights. Your focus is on academic readiness,
    regulatory compliance, ethical guidance, and long-term educational planning
    rather than short-term marketing narratives or oversimplified admission claims.
