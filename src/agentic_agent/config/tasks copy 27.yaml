    Conduct an in-depth aviation and corporate crisis research study focused on
    IndiGo Airlines. The objective is to document the complete origin, ownership,
    business model, scale of operations, and the December 2025 operational crisis.
    Analyze when and how IndiGo was founded, who owns and controls it, how it became
    India’s largest airline, and why it was suddenly hit by a massive crisis.
    For each documented phase and case category:
      - Record founding year, first flight date, founders, and ownership structure
      - Document legal entity, parent company, and shareholding pattern
      - Track fleet growth, destination expansion, and market share evolution
      - Analyze operational model (low-cost structure, fleet strategy, staffing)
      - Identify trigger events leading to the December 2025 disruption
      - Examine regulatory changes (pilot rest rules, DGCA directives)
      - Quantify the scale of cancellations, passenger impact, and refunds
      - Study government and DGCA intervention measures
      - Assess media, public, and market reaction
      - Identify systemic weaknesses in staffing, rostering, and contingency planning
      - Evaluate short-term recovery actions and long-term business implications
      - Compare IndiGo’s crisis handling with other Indian carriers
